2011-06-01 18:19:06 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> Was it easy to figure out the log in?
2011-06-01 18:19:51 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< yeah vey 
2011-06-01 18:19:53 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< very 
2011-06-01 18:19:58 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< well at first I didnt see the chat bar
2011-06-01 18:20:14 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< but after looking around for a few seconds I figured out where it had appeared
2011-06-01 18:20:39 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> ah, yeah, good point, that could be clearer.
2011-06-01 18:21:07 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> So this experiment, as you can see is called emotion twenty questions
2011-06-01 18:21:41 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> it's played like the regular game of twenty questions, but you have to pick an emotion word.
2011-06-01 18:21:50 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< ok
2011-06-01 18:22:22 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< can you give me a description of what is considered an emotion word
2011-06-01 18:22:31 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< I imagine its things such as sad
2011-06-01 18:22:33 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< happy 
2011-06-01 18:22:35 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< etc...
2011-06-01 18:22:57 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> yes, that's right.  It's basically any word that names an emotion.
2011-06-01 18:23:02 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< ok 
2011-06-01 18:23:11 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> And the only difference to the regular game is that sometimes there will be words that are so close that they are indistinguishable
2011-06-01 18:23:17 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> eg, angry and mad

2011-06-01 18:24:17 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> a good way to tell is if you can't feel or describe any difference between the two, then it will count as a correct guess.
2011-06-01 18:24:29 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< Ok
2011-06-01 18:25:26 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580

2011-06-01 18:26:19 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> ah, yes, they have to be yes/no questions.  The answers may have clarifications, but the questions can't ask anything besides yes/no type questions

2011-06-01 18:37:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> no, it's not too typical of most enjoyable activities, though I can think of a few counter examples.

2011-06-01 18:46:45 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> in general, no.  But if the plate were very expensive and you were concerned about someone finding out (like the kid stealing), then maybe...

< Do you feel like this when there is a big event coming up and you "cant wait" for it to happen
2011-06-01 18:52:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> no, actually more the opposite... you don't want it to happen.
2011-06-01 18:52:54 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< how about anxious?
2011-06-01 18:53:04 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< is it the feeling?
2011-06-01 18:54:04 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> yes, it's anxious... I think i'll count it, but that wasn't the exact word.  Do you know it?
2011-06-01 18:54:22 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< no what is it?
2011-06-01 18:55:35 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> I was thinking of worried, but I think that this might be an example of two words that you can't really think of a difference.
2011-06-01 18:55:56 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< Yeah your right im trying to think of differences 
2011-06-01 18:56:08 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< but chances you are if someone is worried they might as well say they are anxious
2011-06-01 18:56:52 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> nervousness I thougth was a little different: you could be nervous about something good about to happen, but worried is mainly if you're waiting for something bad.
2011-06-01 18:57:30 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> or maybe just be a nervous person
2011-06-01 18:57:57 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< yeah I agree same thing with anxiety but I guess someone could argue that if you are anxious you are probably anxious because you fear something might go wrong?
2011-06-01 18:59:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580
> yeah, so it's a bit murky sometimes and people may have different intuitions.
2011-06-01 18:59:58 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< I agree
2011-06-01 19:00:05 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_

2011-06-01 19:00:13 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab9F580 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
