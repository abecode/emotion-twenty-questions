> This is a game/experiment called emotion 20 questions.  It's played much the same as the regular twenty questions game, except that you have to pick and guess emotions, rather than any arbitrary object.

> Questions may need to be answered with more than a simple yes or no since sometimes it's not clear cut.

> and there's one additional rule: sometimes an emotion that a person guesses will be so close that you think you should count it.  A good test to see if you should count it is if you feel they are exactly the same and there's no way you can describe the difference between the two.
