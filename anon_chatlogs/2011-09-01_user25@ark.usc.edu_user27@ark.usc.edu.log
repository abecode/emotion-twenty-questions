2011-09-01 17:59:50 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< Yep, I'm here
2011-09-01 18:00:06 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> cool.
2011-09-01 18:00:11 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> working alright?
2011-09-01 18:00:18 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< so far so good
2011-09-01 18:00:31 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> cool
2011-09-01 18:00:38 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> let me just explain the rules
2011-09-01 18:00:53 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> so it's basically the same as the regular twenty questions game
2011-09-01 18:01:03 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> except you need to pick an emotion 
2011-09-01 18:01:29 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> which should be able to be expressed as a word
2011-09-01 18:02:10 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> the only main difference between this game and the regular 20q game is that sometimes one word will be a very close synonym of another word
2011-09-01 18:02:44 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> so that becomes an issue when someone guesses one word that is very close to the one you picked
2011-09-01 18:03:29 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> So this is somewhat subjective, but the criteria is that if you can't express any difference between the words, you can count it as a correct guess.
2011-09-01 18:03:53 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> any questions?  (about the name, not playing it!_
2011-09-01 18:03:55 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A

2011-09-01 18:04:15 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< sounds pretty straightforward
2011-09-01 18:05:23 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> okay, so I'm going to start by picking the emotion, then you guess (it will be a little difficult because you haven't played, but you'll get the hang of it).
2011-09-01 18:05:40 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> okay, got one.
2011-09-01 18:05:58 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_

2011-09-01 18:07:09 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_

> yes
2011-09-01 18:09:16 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A

2011-09-01 18:10:03 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< 4) is it usually directed at a specific person or object?
2011-09-01 18:10:18 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> no
2011-09-01 18:11:09 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_

> yes, or possibly purple
2011-09-01 18:12:50 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< 6) does it cause a person to go into a high energy state?
2011-09-01 18:13:49 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> yes
2011-09-01 18:14:25 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< 7) can it drive somebody to physically hurt another person?
2011-09-01 18:15:18 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A
> no
2011-09-01 18:15:39 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< is it fear?
2011-09-01 18:15:53 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A

2011-09-01 18:17:44 user27@ark.usc.edu/ijab3A22A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< its hard to get a good grip on describing emotions
