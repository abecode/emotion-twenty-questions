2011-06-06 18:18:16 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab98715
> so this is an experiment which as you can see is called emotion 20 questions.
2011-06-06 18:18:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab98715
> it's played exactly like the regular twenty question game, but you have to choose/guess emotions.
2011-06-06 18:18:54 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab98715 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ok
2011-06-06 18:19:58 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab98715
> the only difference is that we added a rule for when the words are so close as to be verbally indistinguishable, i.e., words that you can't distinguish with any sort of explanation.
