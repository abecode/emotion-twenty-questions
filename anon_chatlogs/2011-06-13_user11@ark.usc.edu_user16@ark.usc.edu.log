2011-06-13 20:35:22 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab41D30 -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A
< kinda, more like being engaged in something
2011-06-13 20:36:05 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A -> user16@ark.usc.edu/
> would this be an emotion you would feel when readying a book?
2011-06-13 20:37:47 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A -> user16@ark.usc.edu/
> reading 
2011-06-13 20:39:04 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab41D30 -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A
< you could, but it's not a very likely emotion you'd be feeling
2011-06-13 20:39:57 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab41D30 -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A

2011-06-13 20:42:16 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab41D30 -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A

2011-06-13 20:46:32 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab41D30 -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A
< not exactly, it's more like determined than pride, because pride more like an emotion you'd feel afterwards and determined is what you feel while you're working on it

< it's similar, but more intense
2011-06-13 20:50:28 user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A -> user16@ark.usc.edu/
> is it closer to being delighted?
2011-06-13 20:51:07 user16@ark.usc.edu/ijab41D30 -> user11@ark.usc.edu/ijab7C29A
< it's like a fusion of determined and delighted
