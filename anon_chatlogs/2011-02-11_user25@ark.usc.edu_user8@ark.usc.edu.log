> I'm basically trying to see how people describe emotions.  So if you can't think of the word, you have to describe it in certain ways.  One definition of a theory is the set of statements that are true about something, so collecting statements is a way of crowdsourcing a theory

2011-02-11 18:33:21 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< i'd love to hear how your research turns out nad it sprocess

2011-02-11 18:34:00 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< what's it like when you are with someone face to face
2011-02-11 18:34:03 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< and they don't speak english

< ?
2011-02-11 18:34:14 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

> yeah, it could be touch about some nuances of words, but if they only have a repetoire of basic emotions, that might make it easier to guess.
2011-02-11 18:35:32 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< well, they could have complex emotions but not hte vocabulary for it, though right?
2011-02-11 18:36:06 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

> Yeah, that's true.  so basically, I think a computer would be like a person learning the language.  So they might not be able to guess something at first, but if they can learn, then next time they'll be able to guess it.

< It's interesting - I  just passed out a story of mine in our grad class (workshopped) a
2011-02-11 18:41:16 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-02-11 18:41:30 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< do you read alot of stories on sex?
2011-02-11 18:41:42 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< like, last week, we read two stories on rape  9anal and teenage)

2011-02-11 18:42:13 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-02-11 18:42:24 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

< "
2011-02-11 18:42:53 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-02-11 18:43:20 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-02-11 18:43:50 user8@ark.usc.edu/ijab45F7D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
