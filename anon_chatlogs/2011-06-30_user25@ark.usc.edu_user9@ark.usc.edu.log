2011-06-30 09:17:45 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> hi there... let's switch over to this technically challenged chat room..
2011-06-30 09:18:15 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> so this is where we play and collect our 20q data
2011-06-30 09:18:50 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> you're probably familiar with the rules of 20q...
2011-06-30 09:19:04 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> you need to ask yes/no questions, etc...
2011-06-30 09:19:09 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yeah, I guess I better be!
2011-06-30 09:19:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> in the case of emotions, it was useful to have an additional stopping condition when the emotions are very close
2011-06-30 09:19:50 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ok
2011-06-30 09:20:14 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> if you can't distinguish between the emotion you picked and the one that the other player guessed, then that counts
2011-06-30 09:20:23 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< right
2011-06-30 09:20:52 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> okay, is it alright if I pick the first emotion?
2011-06-30 09:21:05 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< are there any specific rules about asking for clarification?
2011-06-30 09:21:28 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< i.e., if I'm not sure what you mean by a question? (or vice versa)
2011-06-30 09:22:52 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> well, you can rephrase the question, but also the answerer can clarify it (the answers aren't limited to yes/no, so they can answer 'no, not usually' if it needs to be clarified like that)
2011-06-30 09:23:03 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< OK
2011-06-30 09:23:19 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< happy for you to pick first
2011-06-30 09:24:06 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> okay, I'll pick an easier one to start...
2011-06-30 09:25:07 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< Ready for question 1?
2011-06-30 09:25:21 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> yep, guess away...
2011-06-30 09:25:29 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< 1. Is it a positive emotion?
2011-06-30 09:26:09 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> yes
2011-06-30 09:28:37 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< 2. Is it very obvious to other people if you are having this emotion?
2011-06-30 09:28:55 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> yes
2011-06-30 09:30:29 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< 3. Is it usually an intense emotion?
2011-06-30 09:31:01 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no, not so much
2011-06-30 09:31:57 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< Does it usually last for a short period of time?
2011-06-30 09:32:55 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no
2011-06-30 09:33:02 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< |s it happy?
2011-06-30 09:33:49 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> it is a happy emotion, but happy isn't it.  For me at least, it's slightly different  
2011-06-30 09:34:07 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< OK
2011-06-30 09:34:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> guesses just count as questions, so you can guess as much as you want
2011-06-30 09:34:58 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< OK
2011-06-30 09:36:10 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< Is it associated with something being satisfied (i.e. an aim or a goal?)
2011-06-30 09:37:07 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no, but good question though
2011-06-30 09:38:50 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< is it pleasure? (as in, taking pleasure in something?)
2011-06-30 09:40:44 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no, but it is kind of close.  this emotion is pleasurable and being satisfied is probably a prerequisite, but it's not any one particular aim/goal or cause.
2011-06-30 09:41:07 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< contented?
2011-06-30 09:41:38 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no, this emotion is a little more positive
2011-06-30 09:41:56 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< enjoyment?
2011-06-30 09:44:22 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> also pretty close, but no.  Less about any particular object of enjoyment.  you might enjoy being around a person feeling this emotion though.
2011-06-30 09:44:54 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< enthusiasm?
2011-06-30 09:45:16 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> very close, but not so strong
2011-06-30 09:47:32 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< hmmm  - I'm still here, just thinking
2011-06-30 09:49:09 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no prob... you're in the right vicinity.  I think that happy was your closest guess so far and some players might even consider it a synonym
2011-06-30 09:49:47 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ah ok  -I might have gone off on the wrong track
2011-06-30 09:50:06 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< joy?
2011-06-30 09:50:14 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> all your past couple of guesses are pretty close
2011-06-30 09:50:32 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> no
2011-06-30 09:50:35 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< (although maybe that's too strong)
2011-06-30 09:50:42 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> (yes)
2011-06-30 09:51:44 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< cheerful?
2011-06-30 09:51:49 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> yeah!
2011-06-30 09:52:26 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< phew
2011-06-30 09:52:34 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> good job!  Maybe that wasn't as easy as I was thinking... I was thinking happy was too easy, but maybe you'd guess cheerful shortly after
2011-06-30 09:53:08 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> So some people might consider happy and cheerful to be the same, esp. non-native speakers for example
2011-06-30 09:53:17 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< I think it's just not a word I would use much, so it didn't come to mind after happy
2011-06-30 09:53:37 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9
> do you think it's different than happy?
2011-06-30 09:55:14 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< but that might just be me!
2011-06-30 09:55:38 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ( I guess that's the point)
2011-06-30 09:57:03 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> so do you have time to play again, this time with you picking the emotion?
2011-06-30 09:57:09 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< sure
2011-06-30 09:57:23 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> okay, let me know when you're ready...
2011-06-30 09:57:27 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< got one  - take it away
2011-06-30 09:57:59 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> does this emotion involve a goal or aim?
2011-06-30 09:58:18 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< no, it doesn't have to
2011-06-30 09:59:18 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A

2011-06-30 09:59:28 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-06-30 10:00:24 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-06-30 10:00:41 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> would you say it's a negative emotion?
2011-06-30 10:00:45 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes
2011-06-30 10:01:28 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> is it a strong emotion?
2011-06-30 10:02:51 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< it can be strong, but it doesn't have to be, so I would say no
2011-06-30 10:04:21 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> so is it necessary that there is another person (or other sentient being) involved?
2011-06-30 10:04:30 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes
2011-06-30 10:04:46 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> is it annoyed?
2011-06-30 10:04:53 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-06-30 10:06:26 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes
2011-06-30 10:08:44 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> jealosy?
2011-06-30 10:08:57 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< very close, but not quite the same
2011-06-30 10:09:06 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> envy?
2011-06-30 10:09:09 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yep
2011-06-30 10:09:26 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A

2011-06-30 10:10:04 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< were my answers ok? No misleading obfuscations?
2011-06-30 10:10:36 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yes, I would say so
2011-06-30 10:11:30 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< good - it's funny being on the other end, feels as much of a challenge ensuring that answers are fair representations of the term
2011-06-30 10:11:59 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> I probably should have picked envy before jealosy now that I think about it... b/c no aim/goal.  For jealosy there would be an aim/goal, eg, the girl
2011-06-30 10:12:30 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< true, although you could be envious of someone who has a possession/goal too
2011-06-30 10:12:43 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yeah, the answerer role really gets you thinking about how the emotion is described
2011-06-30 10:12:56 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< e.g. envious of the guy across the hall who just got another paper accepted
2011-06-30 10:13:22 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A

2011-06-30 10:13:40 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< not that ever happens, obviously!
2011-06-30 10:13:46 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> hahaha!
2011-06-30 10:13:52 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/

2011-06-30 10:13:57 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ...
2011-06-30 10:14:19 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> :-) 
2011-06-30 10:14:27 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< I think ASD people could play it
2011-06-30 10:14:45 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< but they'd probably be young adults at least who are fairly high functioning
2011-06-30 10:15:03 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< and the chances of going off down the wrong "garden path" are probably quite high
2011-06-30 10:15:52 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yeah, and maybe you'd have to pick some standard emotions... I purposefully didn't give a list of emotions, but I could see that it might be useful in some cases
2011-06-30 10:16:03 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< for example, understanding of jokes with double meanings, or metaphors tends to be tricky
2011-06-30 10:16:50 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< so handling the synonyms of emotions might be challenging too, i.e they might stick more to one emotion for one kind of state
2011-06-30 10:17:20 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes - having a closed set would probably be a good starting point
2011-06-30 10:19:34 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> The one thing that struck me as interesting about your work, and maybe how it relates to this, is that autistic people had problems planning the best guessing strategy, but for emotions I'm not sure if non-autistic people have a best or correct way to classify emotions
2011-06-30 10:20:18 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes - for this, it's very challenging to think of a systematic plan of questions
2011-06-30 10:20:51 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< positive/negative, for example, feels like it should be a good 50/50 to start, but I'm not even sure on reflection it is
2011-06-30 10:23:26 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> I think that is generallly how people think of emotions... and not a bad strategy.  One of the things that comes up from a computer science perspective is that an algorithm might determine the best stragegy that might not be how people actually think... I have yet to see if that would be possible though
2011-06-30 10:24:21 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes - it seems likely that people will approach the task with some heuristics that may or may not map the set they actually have to search
2011-06-30 10:24:51 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< for example, what would be your opening question on Guess Who?
2011-06-30 10:25:58 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> mmm, I guess male/female...
2011-06-30 10:26:42 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yeah - that's what everybody says. but (at least until recently) there are only 5 women and 19 men on a guess who board
2011-06-30 10:28:56 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yeah, that would be probably something that an computer would pick out right away
2011-06-30 10:30:09 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< now - the problem there is admittedly a bit different as a) its a closed set and b) the set isn't representing the real world
2011-06-30 10:30:58 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< but still, it could be that people's searches don't resemble the frequencies or terms they're faced with
2011-06-30 10:32:16 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> I was thinking for an autistic person who's high functioning (like a savant), they might actually do better than a neurotypical person.  Like a person with photographic memory playing guess who. but maybe I'm kind of thinking of some pop culture image of an autistic person.
2011-06-30 10:32:39 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< well, some could
2011-06-30 10:33:37 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< you get, for example, kids with Aspergers who do really well at a closed set 20Q or Guess Who because they just look at the board at work out the best discrminator each time - essentially an algorithmic approach

< but what I tend to study is the kids who, on average, don't do that and don't seem to have an easy hierarchy/heuristic that comes to mind
2011-06-30 10:34:51 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A

2011-06-30 10:35:55 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A

2011-06-30 10:36:46 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes - but could also be pretty revealing; a lot of teens with ASD would probably say they understand emotion words, and then show they really don't on this
2011-06-30 10:37:04 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< so what's your next step - are you collecting data for a while?
2011-06-30 10:39:01 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yep, I'm still collecting data, and meanwhile I'm trying to work on two directions: making an automated player for the question asking role and trying to understand the answers that are between yes and no (using a kind of scale/slider).
2011-06-30 10:39:36 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< wow - they both sound tricky!
2011-06-30 10:41:30 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> since I'm in the cs dept, I'm trying to see what it would take take for a computer to represent the way people describe emotions.  it's a little tricky, but the thing that helps is that it's actually fun to collect and annotate the data.
2011-06-30 10:42:09 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yes, I can see that
2011-06-30 10:42:49 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A

2011-06-30 10:43:11 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< is there anyway you can set up some unsupervised learning, for the computer system?
2011-06-30 10:43:29 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> I also wanted to ask if you think that the 20q game is good for treating as well as studying autism?
2011-06-30 10:45:35 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< well, I guess it could help with clarifying certain emotion terms for people with ASD
2011-06-30 10:45:56 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< and identifying problems with some word comprehension possibly
2011-06-30 10:46:08 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yes, for unsupervised learning, I'm hoping that by observing emotion and question/answer pairs that it will be possible to do some kind of clustering.  still, it has the manual step of actually picking the question/answer pairs from the raw text...
2011-06-30 10:46:25 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< right
2011-06-30 10:47:01 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< I think the main hurdle would be the level of language (and insight) needed to get something out of the game
2011-06-30 10:47:53 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< but to be honest, I don't know! as far as I know there is literally nothing like it out there
2011-06-30 10:48:10 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> but for the 20q task in general, does it seem like the autistic kids are learning and benefiting from playing the game?
2011-06-30 10:48:27 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> (as opposed to just being a way to study autism)
2011-06-30 10:49:12 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< not necessarily - they enjoy it, but  you don't see big learning effects on game performance itself
2011-06-30 10:49:41 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< and I would take that to suggest that you don't immediately get benefits elsewhere (cognitively)
2011-06-30 10:50:07 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< however, I know that our local schools do engage in specific concept and question training
2011-06-30 10:50:36 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< one of the tricky things with cognitive tasks in ASD is that they wont necessarily
2011-06-30 10:50:57 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ...have lots of insight into where they're going/wrong or right
2011-06-30 10:51:10 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< improvements tend to be associated with more explicit training
2011-06-30 10:51:41 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> so I was thinking that if player B reuses questions from player A (after playing earlier), then that could be a measure of "B learning from A"
2011-06-30 10:52:10 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< Oh right  - yeah, that could happen
2011-06-30 10:52:35 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< I guess we never really switch it round (the questioner/chooser roles) when we play
2011-06-30 10:54:13 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> ah, I see... doing it symmetrically makes it a lot less controlled.
2011-06-30 10:56:10 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< yeah -for my stuff you also get into a lot of questions about Theory of Mind if you switch the roles too - quite often with ASD kids, I try to avoid altogether the idea that I'm "thinking of an x"
2011-06-30 10:56:43 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< instead we show a random generator screen and say the computer picked it
2011-06-30 10:57:16 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< they seem to like that - other people and what they mean can be very tricky!
2011-06-30 10:59:59 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user9@ark.usc.edu/ijab93BE9/ijabE3A5A
> yeah, I guess that's what makes it fun to play.  Right before you guess it, while youre confused it's like anguish, then it's a relief then you guess it.  If the kids don't guess it, that would be an extremely frustrating experience, I would imagine.
2011-06-30 11:00:27 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< ha! yes, it could be. you'd need a grant for some replacement laptops

2011-06-30 11:02:45 user9@ark.usc.edu/ijabE3A5A -> user25@ark.usc.edu/
< as to ASD, I might ask an Aspie friend of mine what he thinks of the idea
