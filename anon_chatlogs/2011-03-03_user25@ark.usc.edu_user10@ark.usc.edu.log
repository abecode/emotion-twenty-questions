2011-03-03 16:28:43 user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< that's not so much an emotion as a state of being...
2011-03-03 16:29:17 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489

2011-03-03 16:29:32 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489

2011-03-03 16:29:59 user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
< emotion is by definition brief... moods are the longer states
2011-03-03 16:31:49 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489

2011-03-03 16:36:20 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_ -> user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489
> yes, as opposed to being caused by something external..
2011-03-03 16:36:31 user10@ark.usc.edu/ijabBD489 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim_
