2011-03-06 17:59:00 user7@ark.usc.edu/ijabC536C -> user15@ark.usc.edu/ijabCF369
< is it frustration?
2011-03-06 17:59:34 user15@ark.usc.edu/ijabCF369 -> user7@ark.usc.edu/
> not exactly, but I would say that frustration is very related to this feeling
2011-03-06 17:59:57 user7@ark.usc.edu/ijabC536C -> user15@ark.usc.edu/ijabCF369
< uncle.  you win.
