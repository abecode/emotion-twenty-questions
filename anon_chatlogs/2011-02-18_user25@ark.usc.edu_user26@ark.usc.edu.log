2011-02-18 12:56:15 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> no, I wouldn't say that it's normally for grudges
2011-02-18 12:57:25 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< would i possibly shout at someone?
2011-02-18 12:58:26 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D

2011-02-18 12:59:03 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> that's 11
2011-02-18 12:59:21 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:00:36 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:01:00 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> no, it's less necessarily directed at another person than your recent guesses
2011-02-18 13:01:26 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:03:05 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< would i feel it if i were disapointed in myself?

> yes
2011-02-18 13:03:40 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> at least possibly
2011-02-18 13:03:53 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< is it regret?
2011-02-18 13:05:18 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> no, it's not about blaming yourself but rather blaming someone else or some situation
2011-02-18 13:05:56 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< you said it wasn't directed towards others
2011-02-18 13:07:04 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> not in general.  it could be your car, homework, programming can make you especially this emotion...
2011-02-18 13:07:32 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< oh, is it frustrated?
2011-02-18 13:07:37 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> aha!
2011-02-18 13:07:41 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> yep
2011-02-18 13:07:42 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< sweet
2011-02-18 13:08:01 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< you should have just said programming from the beginning
2011-02-18 13:08:02 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> that was pretty close, I think you were at 18 or 19
2011-02-18 13:08:21 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> yeah, that one gives it away!
2011-02-18 13:08:49 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yeah maybe there is a way to take into account people's backgrounds into the game
2011-02-18 13:09:34 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< like some simple things like gender, occupation, etc
2011-02-18 13:09:41 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> I was thinking that getting punched in the face or having your dog die could make you frustrated if you get punched in the face every day, or if you have a lot of dogs and they die inconveniently frequently :)
2011-02-18 13:10:18 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yeah i was trying to think of stifled anger
2011-02-18 13:10:30 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> yeah, knowing a persons background could help a lot.  Probably a lot of people don't know whether programming could be frustrating.
2011-02-18 13:10:33 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< which is how i got to resentful and passive aggressive
2011-02-18 13:11:10 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> yeah, that's why I was trying to get you out of the person focused emotions...
2011-02-18 13:11:33 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> but frustrated could be caused by a person though, so that could be confusing.
2011-02-18 13:12:04 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yeah well it's hard becuase it's pretty subjective
2011-02-18 13:12:21 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< even people haven't quite mastered qmpathy
2011-02-18 13:12:29 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< *empathy
2011-02-18 13:12:51 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> yep, maybe the game will help??
2011-02-18 13:13:09 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> so do you want to pick an emotion now?
2011-02-18 13:13:21 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yeah
2011-02-18 13:13:25 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< give me a moment
2011-02-18 13:13:30 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< ok go
2011-02-18 13:14:03 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D

2011-02-18 13:14:14 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:15:31 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< no, it doesn't necessarily have to be directed at anyone
2011-02-18 13:16:33 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> can the emotion just pop up (as opposed to being caused by someone or something)?
2011-02-18 13:16:48 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yes
2011-02-18 13:16:59 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< i guess
2011-02-18 13:17:14 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> dread?
2011-02-18 13:17:27 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< no not so bad
2011-02-18 13:17:39 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> hmm
2011-02-18 13:17:50 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> boredom?
2011-02-18 13:18:16 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< not necessarily but they could cooccur
2011-02-18 13:19:01 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> tired?
2011-02-18 13:19:16 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< that could help trigger this emotion
2011-02-18 13:19:55 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> confused?
2011-02-18 13:20:30 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:21:16 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:21:21 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> hmmm....
2011-02-18 13:21:32 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> lazy?
2011-02-18 13:21:34 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< but you don't necessarily have to be tired
2011-02-18 13:22:20 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< and you don't necessarily have to be physically inactive
2011-02-18 13:23:31 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D

2011-02-18 13:26:07 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:27:08 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> moody?
2011-02-18 13:27:15 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< the opposite
2011-02-18 13:28:13 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> apathetic?
2011-02-18 13:28:26 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yep
2011-02-18 13:28:33 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< well "indifferent"
2011-02-18 13:28:41 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-18 13:29:01 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> ah, yeah, some are so close that it's almost synonyms
2011-02-18 13:29:11 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D

> some times the words are close but the meaning can be different... one person wasn't sure about proud vs pride... can you tell the difference?
2011-02-18 13:30:15 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< yes
2011-02-18 13:30:29 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< proud is generally thought of as a good thing
2011-02-18 13:30:39 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< whereas pride is negative
2011-02-18 13:30:46 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< it's kind of context though
2011-02-18 13:31:01 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D
> yeah, exactly!
2011-02-18 13:31:15 user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim -> user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D

2011-02-18 13:31:33 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< well that might be an interesting analysis

2011-02-18 13:31:50 user26@ark.usc.edu/ijab2AD0D -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
