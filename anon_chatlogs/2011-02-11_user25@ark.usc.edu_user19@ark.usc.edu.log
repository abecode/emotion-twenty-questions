2011-02-11 16:24:56 user19@ark.usc.edu/ijab4FB73 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
< duration, and magnitude (was it valence?)

2011-02-11 16:27:08 user19@ark.usc.edu/ijab4FB73 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-11 16:27:23 user19@ark.usc.edu/ijab4FB73 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-11 16:27:42 user19@ark.usc.edu/ijab4FB73 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-11 16:27:49 user19@ark.usc.edu/ijab4FB73 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim

2011-02-11 16:28:32 user19@ark.usc.edu/ijab4FB73 -> user25@ark.usc.edu/Gajim
