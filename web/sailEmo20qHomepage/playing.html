  <h1> <img src="emo20q.gif"/> Playing Emotion Twenty Questions </h1>

   
    <p> If you'd like to play, you have several options.  The most
    recent, automated, demos where you play against a computer can be
    found on <a href='demos.html'> the demos page </a>. This include both web-based demos, which are convenient, and downloadable demos, where you can modify the source code if you so desire.  There are also older demos for historical purposes. </p> 

  <p> To play the human-human (online chat) version of the game,
    please email the
    moderator, <a href='http://sail.usc.edu/~kazemzad'> Abe
    Kazemzadeh </a>, at kazemzad AT usc DOT edu.  You will get a
    username/password that will let you log in.  You can
    use <a href='http://sail.usc.edu/~kazemzad/emo20q/hhchat.html'>this
    webpage</a> or any jabber client (if you choose to use a 3rd party
    jabber client, like iChat, pidgin, or gajim, you must add
    @ark.usc.edu to your username when logging in, i.e. a full Jabber
    ID).  When logged in and in the middle of playing a game, please
    set your status to busy so that other players do not bother
    you.  </p>
