This is a repository for code and data from the Emotion Twenty Questions (emo20q) project, which aims to collect human intuitions about emotions using natural language games, in particular the familiar game of twenty questions.

The repository include:
  * [rules of the game](Rules.md),
  * [Code for Emo20q dialog agents](http://code.google.com/p/emotion-twenty-questions/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk),
  * [setup for Ejabberd/XMPP chat servers and clients for human-human data collection](EjabberdConfiguration.md),
  * [anonymized data collected from the game](Data.md), and
  * tools to study the collected data.
