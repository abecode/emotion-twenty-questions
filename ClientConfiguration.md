# Introduction #

Any such XMPP client should work fine for the purposes of EMO20Q.  However, for usability and support reasons, it is best to have the user log in through a web-based client.  This makes it so the users don't have to install any software nor configure it with the JID, which is trivial but has the potential to confuse and make unnecessary hassles.



# Details #

The web-based XMPP client we use is called [iJab](http://code.google.com/p/ijab/) (it is also hosted on google code!).  Please see this page for details.  If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask and we'll add more details here as needed.
