# Introduction #

Emotion twenty question is played much like the familiar game of twenty questions, but instead of choosing any object, one player must pick an emotion word.

# Player Roles #

There are two roles that players alternate between:
  * The _answerer_ chooses an emotion word and answers questions.
  * The _questioner_ tries to guess the emotion word in 20 or fewer questions.

Ideally each player should have at one chance to play each role.  Playing the game an even number of times will ensure that each player has played each role the same number of times

# Matches, Rounds, and Tournaments #

A _match_ consists of players assuming a role assignment, the answerer picking an emotion, and the questioner trying to guess it.  A match ends when the questioner correctly guesses the emotion, gives up, or goes over 20 questions.

A _round_ is two matches between the same players in which each player has had a chance to play each role.  A round is similar to an inning in baseball.

A _tournament_ is a series of matches among a number of players.

# Questions and Answers #

Questions must be posed as a yes/no question.  If a player asks a non-yes/no question, the other player should correct them and the question may be rephrased.

The answers should answer the question truthfully and without giving away too much information.  Ideally the answer would be either yes or no, but in many cases it will be difficult to give a clear-cut yes or no.  In these cases, it might be necessary to clarify an answer.  Also, to keep the game fun for players that may be stuck, the answerer can give hints that help the questioner get unstuck.  Wait until the player is stuck and running out of questions to give a hint.

# Winning and Losing #

Emo20q is intended to be a fun, collaborative game.  The only loosers are those who do not play.  That being said, players can and should be judged on their performance.  Of course not guessing the emotion in less than 20 questions is a considered a loss, but different words are more difficult than others so a loss on a difficult word should not be taken too harshly.  As players become more experienced, they may hone in on particular questions and this may allow them to identify emotions with fewer guesses, which leads to a feeling of accomplishment.  On the other hand, players may choose to ask innovative, risky questions leading to a different feeling of accomplishment by surprising the other player.

# Synonyms #

It became clear in early games that there are some emotions that are practically indistiguishable, e.g., "mad" and "angry".  For these emotions, we have an alternative stopping criteria where the game can end successfully by guessing one of these words that mean exactly the same thing.  The criteria used to decide this is that the answerer cannot think of any difference between the words that can be expressed in natural language (besides spelling).  In this case, the answerer should explain that the word guessed has the same meaning.  The questioner can still guess if he/she chooses, but the game effectively ends after the guessing of the exact synonym.

# After-Action Discussion #

players are encouraged to address any issues that game up in the game after the match.  For example, a questioner may feel that the emotion word was not really an emotion, or the answerer may explain an answer to a question that was hard to answer.
