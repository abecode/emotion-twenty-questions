      1  aha! yep
      1  aha! yes
      1  aha, yes, good one. youre not terrible, just your strategy  :-P
      1  aha... yes, you got it!
      1  ah...hmmmm.... i guess i have to say no...
      1  almost
      1  almost it might be almost the same more negative
      1  almost its a bit more geared to when you are frustrated with another person I can tell u know because I think its almost the same as frustrated if u want
      1  angry
      1  aww, well, yes we share it but it's not my word
      1  blue
      1  both.
      1  but i had a different word in mind
      1  by similar you mean ? synonym? no
      2  close
      1  close.
      1  close (10)
      1  close.... but I think it's even more outward feeling toward someone who are experiencing a situation....
      1  close but, no
      1  close,but no
      1  could be both yes and no
      1  could be stronger sorry I meant to say no, stronger
      1  could be yeah but not necesarilly necessarily
      1  depends on the eight grader :) j/k no...
      1  ding ding ding!  Yes  :-) 
      1  do something about this emotion?..what do you mean by that? i dont get the question ...ha..so answer would be..i dont know..probably more no
      1  eh... yes, you could say so.
      1  exaperated exasperated that is it!!!!
      1  expressed to others
      1  for me it results in lower stress levels
      1  generally
      1  generally yes, but not necessarily
      1  good question!  yes, they should know the word (but it's not applied to them)
      1  hahahah no ithough to put that...but it was too greek ;-)
      1  hahaha how can i know?? but yes i suppose if the drug was supposed to make you high/activated
      1  hehe no... but close
      1  hehe nope
      1  hmm, I'd say yes in general
      1  hmmm that's a hard one... iguess not really
      1  hmm not exactly... (but again one could)
      1  I am sorry, because I thought it was an easy one, but it turns out not that easy no
      1  (I don't even know the word)
      1  i don't see any difference in terms of natural language description.... so... yes... mine was pity
      1  I don't think it's relevant in that context. Adults experience this emotion too any guesses? i guess it's a tough one
      2  I don't think so
      1  I dont think so its very much like being furious
      1  if you like sun very very much then yes it is possible
      1  i guess that's close enough:)
      1  I'm going to say yes, at least it feels like it does.
      1  in general, no
      1  in general, no.
      1  in general, no.  But if the plate were very expensive and you were concerned about someone finding out (like the kid stealing), then maybe...
      1  in most scenarios probably not
      1  Interesting question.  It can be a verb as well as an adjective
      1  it can be but it is not necessarily positive
      1  it can be, but not necessarily.
      1  it can be, but not only for people
      1  it can be... it is a reaction to events (where goals and people are a subset of events)
      1  it can, but not usually
      1  it can help.... you don't need someone, but it can help.  I think it could be slightly contagious.
      1  it could
      1  it could be but it could be the opposite
      1  it could be it doesn't necessarily lead you to taking action it's experienced during observation
      1  it could but not necessarily
      1  it depends
      1  it has to do with sth sudden not exhilarated
      1  i think i get it, I would say neutral, but maybe a little red
      1  I think it could be, but not extremely lets say medium
      1  i think it could be strong but the word implies rather mild
      1  I think so... I don't normally steal stuff from friends though ;-) 
      1  I think so, specially when compared to its opposite
      1  I think that's number 16 no, that's a near synonym, but I think it's slightly different
      1  I think that when it occurs, it can overtake any "regular" or "everyday" emotions
      1  it is a synonym for anger the word i was thinking was mad, so we'll count that. then we can start with yoy chosing a word
      1  it is happy, but that's not it.
      1  it is not
      1  It is often unexpected. There are times when it's solicited by others & I like to solicit it in others. but you know, sometimes i think it's too often in stuff we see like movies and tv and stuff but i'm not certain b/c i haven't seen a movie inor tv in a long long time but i walk past the ads for htem on the subway platform or subway and it's THERE you know?
      1  it really depends..but i would say more often yes
      1  it requires humor? or maybe you need humor to not be embarassed afterward after going through said emotion
      1  it's a lesser form so noo
      1  it's a synonym so i'll give it to you but you can guess the right word if you want
      1  it's clearly positive
      1  its different it is a reaction to something funny rather than something pleasing so no almost the same intensity
      1  it's like satisfaction but directed towards someone else and their actions
      1  it's more intense than joyful you could feel joyful in the same time
      1  it's not depressed ... I would say it is more like a symptom ...
      1  it's possible, but generally i guess i'd say no
      1  it would depend on the context if the thief were present, then maybe
      1  kind of  related to contentment
      1  kind of similar
      1  less intense
      1  maybe
      1  maybe a little bit less intense than enthralled
      1  maybe it solicits amuseument in others?
      1  maybe you could feel it
      1  missing a person?..ok..i'll have to interpret that myself..yeah..it can be.. ok i'll say yes for that one then
      1  mmmm no
      1  mmmm very close
      1  mmm yes
      1  more intense
      1  mostly
      1  mostly not
      2  negative
      1  negative no i think u should ask yes or no question
    158  no
      1  no!
      2  no.
      1  No
      1  no, actually more the opposite... you don't want it to happen.
      1  no, a little less active
      1  no a little less intense I think
      1  no all that you say are more internal I think
      1  no, although I try to stay somewhat close to it.
      1  no and $4
      1  no a similar one
      1  no (but can do after the test.)
      1  no but close
      1  no, but close
      1  no, but close.
      1  no, but close.  It might come before relief.
      1  no, but closely related with accomplished. the more accomplished you are, the more you will feel this emotion...
      1  no but delirious is negative is more like mentally unstable
      1  no but in regards to your earlier question "do you feel it when something goes wrong," the answer is yes, but it's not necessarily when something has gone wrong
      1  no but it is in the neighborhood 
      1  no but it's not considered the worst kind of emotion either
      1  no, but I would feel it maybe after an exam
      1  no but let mw look it up to see if it is a synonym (my vocabul;ary is not that great, keep that in mind ;-)) ok its really close you got it i think it was thrilled
      1  no, but right direction
      1  no, but still pretty close
      1  no, but very close.
      1  no. but very close just different word with a bit less negative feeling
      1  no, but very similar sad for long time, you can think it as
      1  no but you are close maybe i should give it to you
      1  no but you may feel content at the same time
      1  no close tho you want to keep guessing you are so close I dont think you can ask anything that will get you closer cause they are almost synonyms
      1  NO! do you pay attention to my answers to questions you already asked? it's associated with NOT using a substance
      1  no Do you want a hint?
      1  no eating something bad isn't really an emotion
      1  no, even stronger.
      1  no, excited was more close
      1  no give up?
      1  no (i count that as one question, so you have asked 9 already)
      1  no, I'd say it's less intense but maybe longer lasting
      1  no, I meant you can feel it towards another person, but also for yourself and other things
      1  no in general
      1  no  is it close to hostility?
      1  no.  It can be, but not necessarily
      1  no, it can be, but other things as well
      1  no it doesn't really have to do with how you feel about the current situation
      1  no it doesnt really relate to karma 
      1  no (i think that should count as one question though because i would have told you after 17 if it was)
      1  No, it is associated with alcohol
      1  no it is more inward but it could be felt about people
      1  no, it is more spontaneous
      1  no it is not so high intensity
      2  no it is positive
      1  no it is stronger than that
      1  no it may be influenced by the results of others, so
      1  no it' neutral *it's
      1  no, it's an emotion my dog & i frequently share
      1  no, it's different.  Actually relating to the first question, even though it would be considered a positive emotion, it might not make the experiencer feel happyness, joy, etc.
      1  no, it's got more of the attainment of goals, but not necessarily a specific goal
      1  no, it's less necessarily directed at another person than your recent guesses
      1  no it's more close to thrilled and delighted but you can feel ephoria at the same time
      1  no.... it's more outward
      1  no, it's not about blaming yourself but rather blaming someone else or some situation
      1  no, it's not too typical of most enjoyable activities, though I can think of a few counter examples.
      1  no, it's very breif *brief
      1  no, I wouldn't say that it's normally for grudges
      1  no i would say the degree is about the same whether positive or negative
      1  no. jeolous is almost right but a bit less negative meaning in it or you can think as almost synonym
      1  no, less about after attainment, and more about before attainment
      1  no less intense than that you would feel it if you went tomorrow for vacations
      1  no, more intense
      1  no more negative 
      1  nono
      1  no...not as a direct effect at least
      1  no, not at all
      1  no not exactly but very close
      1  no, not generally
      2  no not necessarily
      1  no, not necessarily
      1  no not necessarily at least
      1  no not necessarily but could b be
      1  no not necessarily but could be ...
      1  no not really
      1  no not that blue
      1  no. not this time, but yes for last time
      1  no, not usually
      1  no, not usually super intense, but maybe in some cases
      1  no, often after or during something negative
      1  no opposite u did 2 questions
      1  no ( :P )
     12  nope
      1  nope, a lot stronger.
      1  nope, colder
      1  nope. do i reveal it now?
      1  no, pity could also have a positive aspect but they are related
      1  no probably not at least, although i could envision a scenario in which you would
      1  no, rather the opposite you feel it for someone you know
      1  no... sensible isn't highly activated  :-P
      1  no, serious.
      1  no....similar though
      1  no- something in between the firs & escond guess
      1  no, stronger and less patience!
      1  no, stronger than perseverence/persistence... even tougher situation
      1  not amazement you feel it when you expect something to happen
      1  not exactly, but it is related...focused was closer
      1  not exactly, but I would say that frustration is very related to this feeling
      1  not exactly, but you are close to it
      1  no, that's 6
      1  no... that's number 4.
      1  no (that was 5)
      1  no the more you feel this emotion, the more likely you will undertake and accomplish stuff
      1  no... think stronger and more dealing a specific situation
      1  no think TV
      4  not necessarily
      1  Not necessarily, again! But most of the time
      1  not necessarily but it could be
      1  not necessarily but you could I suppose
      1  not necessarily it could thought i mean though
      1  not necessarily You may feel like that or may not...it's not that related to frustration
      1  no too far from frustrated
      1  not precisely little lighter than that (i guess)
      1  not quite
      2  not really
      1  not so much for getting punched in the face
      1  :) not sure, maybe - you were very close. It is a synonym of something you mentioned earlier
      1  Not that much
      1  not that much i guess
      1  not that much it is more associated with a situation that has happenned ** correction for question6: you may feel this emotion also when you are waiting for something, not only if something has happenned
      1  not usually.
      1  not when you're done, but maybe before it's done, while you're working on it
      1  no, u got further
      1  no u may feel embarrased because ur result is not good but target emotion may follow that you saw the other person's result is good
      1  no unless you were looking for an opportunity to do a nice act and you were afforded the opportunity
      1  no u r going far
      1  no very close
      1  no want me to spill it? i guess it was tough.
      1  no you can just feel it but it isnt necessarily vicious
      1  no you could be surprised first and then feel that (but it is not necessary) actually excited was very close
      1  no, you're getting farther now.
      1  oh very close, but no
      1  oh yeah
      1  ooh, you're very close!
      1  other
      1  other (it can be, but not necessarily)
      2  perhaps
      1  perhaps, but it wouldn't be your primary emotion
      1  ( :P ) It is melancholic ...
      1  possibly but its doubtful
      1  possibly, yes
      1  pretty close...
      1  probably you would feel it, but it's not that strong
      1  red yes
      1  sometimes
      1  sorry no
      1  sorry no yeah i can quickly see the problem with this there are many synonyms for some emotions so it can get pretty difficult
      1  sort of, but it can be righteous
      1  that is ridiculously close but it doesn't have to be sudden
      1  that's a hard one i'd say yes
      1  that's getting closer, but still stronger.
      1  that too.
      1  the emotion? no
      1  then no, it is not spontaneous
      1  this is hard to choose...if i really had to choose without trying to clarify it...i would say calm
      1  this word would be right next to it in a thesaurus! not alphabeticaly
      1  those feelings could co-occur with feeling this emotion in a positive way actually i guess the could co-coccur in a negative sense but then the influence would be in the opposite sense
      1  to the first, no. to the second yes. (so more nonverbally) (though that one is tough to say as well)
      1  uhm no its more towards stressed out rather than scared but more intense than nervous
      1  Uhm not necessarily it is felt in similar situations but its not the same.
      1  umm i would say yes
      1  ummm.. I think so kind of
      1  umm not as much as happiness, sadness, etc. but you can still read it in context
      1  umm yes. it can be realted to both actually when result came out, mine is bad and yours is good. what emotion would I get?
      1  usually, yes.
      1  very close
      1  well i'd say yes well wait sorry probably not no
      1  well .. if u feel it for a while .. not over days
      1  well, it's more sure that something will happen so you are not hoping you look forwrd to it *forward
      1  well .. no that much but to an extent can lead to sadness
      1  well there can be a misunderstanding here ... it's not necessarily part of the frustration state it could be considered more to be a consequence 
      2  yea
      1  yea!
      1  yeah
      1  yeah hehe i had to look it up after you said pride
      1  yep
      1  yep! good one
      1  yep! that was it
      1  yep  :-) way to go
     73  yes
      1  yes :)
      2  yes!
      1  yes!!
      1  yes.
      1  Yes
      1  YES!!!
      1  yes (3)
      1  yes, among other things...
      1  yes (and yes... it's a yes/no question)
      1  yes  at least possibly
      1  yes! bulls eye
      1  yes but a very good surprise (it could also affect physically like the drug) it is not necassarily a surprise though, its more that its sth sudden
      1  yes. but I think they may feel that when they feel after failing the screeening
      1  yes...but it's not something you associate with bad or naughty kids
      1  yes, but mostly kept to yourself
      1  yes but not necessarily
      1  yes but that is the right track just more intense
      1  yes, but that was too easy hahah lets go again
      1  yes but this is not the only case you can feel that also when you are waiting for something nice to happen
      1  yes but typically i would think it is cause by external events
      1  yes, can you put number on your question please?
      1  yes, close to desire but not exactly that
      1  yes definitely
      1  yes, definitely.
      1  yes! ding ding ding!
      1  yes, getting closer
      1  yes... good job!
      1  yes!  Good job!
      1  yes haha :-D
      1  yes! haha... good job
      1  yes!  Happy valentines day  <3
      1  yes in general
      1  yes. in general.
      1  yes, in general, especially about the situation.
      1  yes it can be
      1  yes, it can be (can I say more than "yes"?)
      1  yes it can be more I would say, related to mentally tired
      1  yes it can be... you were really close earlier~
      1  yes, it could
      1  yes it could cause them to make poor decisions
      1  yes i think so i think it depends on situation
      1  yes, i think so perhaps playful comes from it
      1  yes (it is related to another person. but it's more like what I feel from the other person when I see) (wasn't sure about directed, so. )
      1  yes it is very related to that
      1  yes it is! you are very close!
      1  yes, it's anxious... I think i'll count it, but that wasn't the exact word.  Do you know it?
      1  yes, it's common, but maybe not everyday
      1  yes it's usually very strong
      1  yes i would assume so yes
      1  yes, more specifically in has to do with how one perceives a situation
      1  yes! my dog feels silly :D & I
      1  yes or smiling or at least smiling inside...if you know what I mena mean
      1  yes, perhaps through explanation
      1  yes, possibly, especially if you had this emotion long enough.
      1  yes, probably more frequently than adults
      1  yes so not always intense* so it can be mild to but not so mild for it to be neutral
      1  yes sort of well possible is a better answer i mean possibly
      1  yesss
      1  yessss!!!!!
      1  YESSSSS!!!!!! :):) congrats!!!!
      1  yess!!!! u r geius good good *genius, I mean
      1  yes, that's 4.
      1  yes, that's getting close
      1  yes, that's right.
      1  yes, that too
      1  yes, the name with "ness", but the state is the associated adjective definitely It is associated with using a chemical substance
      1  yes, there's usually some happiness during and possibly after this emotion
      1  yes (to me, but not sure if yes to others. so it's more like subjective)
      3  yes to some extent
      1  yes! u r genius
      1  yes!! u r right! u r genius haha
      1  yes. very likely
      1  yes! well, the word i had in mind was "fear" but being scared is a product of that
      1  yes :) wow
      1  yes yey~ u r genius
      1  yes you can not always tho
      1  yes you could
      1  yes you do i suppose but the example with the team that you gave was the one that described it best (how can i know since i am not married???)
      1  yes you got it
      1  yes!!! :-) you got it, you are a genius too
      1  yes (you=me in particular)
      1  you are close you can be happy for a long period of time but you can feel this emotion more temporarily
      1  you are joyful when you feel it
      1  you are very close it is basically like a synonym delighted is something that is not really expressed what I am thinking may be expressed by nods or body movements
      1  You could but its not common
      1  you could but not always
      1  you could but you could also feel it towards someone you don't know personally
      1  you could, but you could have an enemy and still not feel that towards him
      1  you could yes
      1  you definitely could if they merit it
      1  you got it! good job!
      1  you got it! Good job :)
      1  you might feel that if you love someone, but not necessarily and you might feel that for someone you don;t love
      1  you're pretty close man don't give up no
      1  you were closer with amazed here is a very abstract hint there are two words that mean the opposite thing and they both start with this word
      1  you wouldn't feel ambition towards someone else
      2  yup!
