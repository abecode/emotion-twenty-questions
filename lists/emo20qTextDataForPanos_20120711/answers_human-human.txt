no 
yep 
no 
it's possible, but generally i guess i'd say no 
hmmm that's a hard one... iguess not really 
yes 
nope 
nope 
hehe nope 
yep! that was it 
negative 
I'm going to say yes, at least it feels like it does. 
for me it results in lower stress levels 
eh... yes, you could say so. 
no 
nope 
it can be, but not necessarily. 
no not that blue 
no 
yes, definitely. 
you got it! good job! 
yes 
yes 
no 
no 
no 
no 
no 
but i had a different word in mind 
no 
yes 
yeah hehe i had to look it up after you said pride 
other 
other (it can be, but not necessarily) 
yes 
no 
yes (you=me in particular) 
no 
yes 
yep! good one 
I think that when it occurs, it can overtake any "regular" or "everyday" emotions 
both. 
It is often unexpected. There are times when it's solicited by others & I like to solicit it in others. but you know, sometimes i think it's too often in stuff we see like movies and tv and stuff but i'm not certain b/c i haven't seen a movie inor tv in a long long time but i walk past the ads for htem on the subway platform or subway and it's THERE you know? 
the emotion? no 
no- something in between the firs & escond guess 
no, it's an emotion my dog & i frequently share 
aww, well, yes we share it but it's not my word 
yes, i think so perhaps playful comes from it 
no 
it's a lesser form so noo 
maybe it solicits amuseument in others? 
it requires humor? or maybe you need humor to not be embarassed afterward after going through said emotion 
this word would be right next to it in a thesaurus! not alphabeticaly 
yes! my dog feels silly :D & I 
no, although I try to stay somewhat close to it. 
yes 
that too. 
it can help.... you don't need someone, but it can help.  I think it could be slightly contagious. 
kind of  related to contentment 
good question!  yes, they should know the word (but it's not applied to them) 
close. 
depends on the eight grader :) j/k no... 
Interesting question.  It can be a verb as well as an adjective 
pretty close... 
nope, colder 
you got it! Good job :) 
yes, can you put number on your question please? 
maybe 
no 
no and $4 
no 
yes 
no 
yes 
close (10) 
yes! ding ding ding! 
it is happy, but that's not it. 
yes 
usually, yes. 
yes, that's 4. 
yes!  Happy valentines day  <3 
yes 
yes 
yes (3) 
no 
no 
yes 
no 
close 
close 
no 
no 
no 
no 
yes. in general. 
yes 
yes, that's right. 
no, serious. 
no, not at all 
no 
no... that's number 4. 
no 
no.  It can be, but not necessarily 
no 
yes 
yes but not necessarily 
no 
no 
i think it could be strong but the word implies rather mild 
no 
no 
yes, more specifically in has to do with how one perceives a situation 
yes 
yes. 
not usually. 
hmm, I'd say yes in general 
in general, no. 
no, it's different.  Actually relating to the first question, even though it would be considered a positive emotion, it might not make the experiencer feel happyness, joy, etc. 
yes, in general, especially about the situation. 
yes, getting closer 
no 
no, you're getting farther now. 
no 
no... sensible isn't highly activated  :-P 
no... think stronger and more dealing a specific situation 
no, even stronger. 
nope, a lot stronger. 
that's getting closer, but still stronger. 
no. 
ooh, you're very close! 
no, stronger than perseverence/persistence... even tougher situation 
no, stronger and less patience! 
yes! 
no 
nope 
perhaps 
no, not generally 
maybe you could feel it 
nope 
no 
kind of similar 
not so much for getting punched in the face 
no, I wouldn't say that it's normally for grudges 
yes, possibly, especially if you had this emotion long enough. 
no 
no. 
no, it's less necessarily directed at another person than your recent guesses 
probably you would feel it, but it's not that strong 
yes  at least possibly 
no, it's not about blaming yourself but rather blaming someone else or some situation 
aha! yep 
yes 
no 
no it is not so high intensity 
I don't think so 
no a little less intense I think 
mmm yes 
no, but I would feel it maybe after an exam 
more intense 
not quite 
no all that you say are more internal I think 
yes :) 
yessss!!!!! 
yes sort of well possible is a better answer i mean possibly 
possibly but its doubtful 
no but you may feel content at the same time 
no unless you were looking for an opportunity to do a nice act and you were afforded the opportunity 
it's like satisfaction but directed towards someone else and their actions 
yep  :-) way to go 
negative no i think u should ask yes or no question 
no 
yes (it is related to another person. but it's more like what I feel from the other person when I see) (wasn't sure about directed, so. ) 
yes 
no (that was 5) 
no 
no 
yes 
yes yey~ u r genius 
yes 
yes 
no 
yes it is very related to that 
no it is positive 
yes, close to desire but not exactly that 
you might feel that if you love someone, but not necessarily and you might feel that for someone you don;t love 
no 
no it is positive 
no (i count that as one question, so you have asked 9 already) 
no not really 
yes!! 
yes!!! :-) you got it, you are a genius too 
no 
no 
yes 
no 
yes 
no 
no 
you could, but you could have an enemy and still not feel that towards him 
no, rather the opposite you feel it for someone you know 
no, pity could also have a positive aspect but they are related 
yes :) wow 
not necessarily but it could be 
yes 
it could 
not necessarily it could thought i mean though 
you wouldn't feel ambition towards someone else 
it can be but it is not necessarily positive 
no 
it could be but it could be the opposite 
no 
no i would say the degree is about the same whether positive or negative 
yes 
no not necessarily 
you definitely could if they merit it 
you could but you could also feel it towards someone you don't know personally 
those feelings could co-occur with feeling this emotion in a positive way actually i guess the could co-coccur in a negative sense but then the influence would be in the opposite sense 
it could be it doesn't necessarily lead you to taking action it's experienced during observation 
yes 
no (i think that should count as one question though because i would have told you after 17 if it was) 
that is ridiculously close but it doesn't have to be sudden 
it's a synonym so i'll give it to you but you can guess the right word if you want 
you were closer with amazed here is a very abstract hint there are two words that mean the opposite thing and they both start with this word 
yes 
no 
no 
no 
no 
no 
yes 
no 
no 
yes (to me, but not sure if yes to others. so it's more like subjective) 
no (but can do after the test.) 
close,but no 
no 
oh very close, but no 
yess!!!! u r geius good good *genius, I mean 
yes 
not necessarily 
yes 
yes 
no 
no, excited was more close 
no you could be surprised first and then feel that (but it is not necessary) actually excited was very close 
it's more intense than joyful you could feel joyful in the same time 
no 
not amazement you feel it when you expect something to happen 
mmmm no 
well, it's more sure that something will happen so you are not hoping you look forwrd to it *forward 
maybe a little bit less intense than enthralled 
very close 
you are very close it is basically like a synonym delighted is something that is not really expressed what I am thinking may be expressed by nods or body movements 
mmmm very close 
I am sorry, because I thought it was an easy one, but it turns out not that easy no 
no it's more close to thrilled and delighted but you can feel ephoria at the same time 
no less intense than that you would feel it if you went tomorrow for vacations 
no, more intense 
yes 
I think it could be, but not extremely lets say medium 
no 
no 
no 
no, that's 6 
aha, yes, good one. youre not terrible, just your strategy  :-P 
no, less about after attainment, and more about before attainment 
no 
no, but right direction 
no 
no, a little less active 
no, it's got more of the attainment of goals, but not necessarily a specific goal 
no, but closely related with accomplished. the more accomplished you are, the more you will feel this emotion... 
no the more you feel this emotion, the more likely you will undertake and accomplish stuff 
aha! yes 
then no, it is not spontaneous 
yes 
not necessarily 
generally 
not really 
it depend 
nope 
nope 
nope 
yes 
nope 
nope 
it can be... it is a reaction to events (where goals and people are a subset of events) 
yes! haha... good job 
no 
sort of, but it can be righteous 
sometimes 
no 
no 
YES!!! 
yes 
it is a synonym for anger the word i was thinking was mad, so we'll count that. then we can start with yoy chosing a word 
negative 
perhaps 
no but it's not considered the worst kind of emotion either 
yes it could cause them to make poor decisions 
no...not as a direct effect at least 
no 
I don't think so 
yes, probably more frequently than adults 
yes, perhaps through explanation 
yes...but it's not something you associate with bad or naughty kids 
no 
in most scenarios probably not 
I don't think it's relevant in that context. Adults experience this emotion too any guesses? i guess it's a tough one 
nope. do i reveal it now? 
no 
no give up? 
not exactly, but I would say that frustration is very related to this feeling 
not really 
no 
no 
yes 
not necessarily 
no 
ding ding ding!  Yes  :-)  
yes 
no 
yes 
mostly not 
no 
no 
not necessarily 
no in general 
no 
no 
mostly 
:) not sure, maybe - you were very close. It is a synonym of something you mentioned earlier 
no 
no....similar though 
no very close 
no 
sorry no yeah i can quickly see the problem with this there are many synonyms for some emotions so it can get pretty difficult 
no think TV 
no 
no 
no 
no want me to spill it? i guess it was tough. 
sorry no 
no! 
yes, it's common, but maybe not everyday 
yes 
if you like sun very very much then yes it is possible 
yes 
not that much it is more associated with a situation that has happenned ** correction for question6: you may feel this emotion also when you are waiting for something, not only if something has happenned 
you are joyful when you feel it 
no, it is more spontaneous 
you are close you can be happy for a long period of time but you can feel this emotion more temporarily 
yes but this is not the only case you can feel that also when you are waiting for something nice to happen 
no not necessarily at least 
yes it is! you are very close! 
YESSSSS!!!!!! :):) congrats!!!! 
perhaps, but it wouldn't be your primary emotion 
yes it's usually very strong 
no probably not at least, although i could envision a scenario in which you would 
it would depend on the context if the thief were present, then maybe 
no 
yes 
yes! well, the word i had in mind was "fear" but being scared is a product of that 
yes 
yesss 
well i'd say yes well wait sorry probably not no 
to the first, no. to the second yes. (so more nonverbally) (though that one is tough to say as well) 
no 
no 
yes 
hehe no... but close 
no 
no 
no 
no 
ah...hmmmm.... i guess i have to say no... 
no 
that's a hard one i'd say yes 
you're pretty close man don't give up no 
no 
no 
no 
blue 
do something about this emotion?..what do you mean by that? i dont get the question ...ha..so answer would be..i dont know..probably more no 
it really depends..but i would say more often yes 
yes it can be 
this is hard to choose...if i really had to choose without trying to clarify it...i would say calm 
no but close 
no 
missing a person?..ok..i'll have to interpret that myself..yeah..it can be.. ok i'll say yes for that one then 
nope 
yes it can be... you were really close earlier~ 
expressed to others 
no 
no 
nono 
no 
i guess that's close enough:) 
devastated 
yes in general 
it could but not necessarily 
yes 
yes but typically i would think it is cause by external events 
no 
no eating something bad isn't really an emotion 
yes you could 
no 
no 
no 
no it doesn't really have to do with how you feel about the current situation 
no it is more inward but it could be felt about people 
no not exactly but very close 
yes you got it 
yes 
not precisely little lighter than that (i guess) 
(I don't even know the word) 
no.... it's more outward 
yes 
close.... but I think it's even more outward feeling toward someone who are experiencing a situation.... 
i don't see any difference in terms of natural language description.... so... yes... mine was pity 
no 
no not necessarily but could be ... 
no not necessarily but could b be 
no 
yes it can be more I would say, related to mentally tired 
by similar you mean ? synonym? no 
well there can be a misunderstanding here ... it's not necessarily part of the frustration state it could be considered more to be a consequence  
no 
no 
no 
no 
it's not depressed ... I would say it is more like a symptom ... 
( :P ) It is melancholic ... 
yes 
yes 
you could yes 
hmm not exactly... (but again one could) 
yes you do i suppose but the example with the team that you gave was the one that described it best (how can i know since i am not married???) 
no 
no it is stronger than that 
hahaha how can i know?? but yes i suppose if the drug was supposed to make you high/activated 
hahahah no ithough to put that...but it was too greek ;-) 
yes i would assume so yes 
no but you are close maybe i should give it to you 
it has to do with sth sudden not exhilarated 
yes but a very good surprise (it could also affect physically like the drug) it is not necassarily a surprise though, its more that its sth sudden 
no but delirious is negative is more like mentally unstable 
no but let mw look it up to see if it is a synonym (my vocabul;ary is not that great, keep that in mind ;-)) ok its really close you got it i think it was thrilled 
no 
no opposite u did 2 questions 
ummm.. I think so kind of 
oh yeah 
no, but very similar sad for long time, you can think it as 
yes. but I think they may feel that when they feel after failing the screeening 
yes!! u r right! u r genius haha 
no 
not that much i guess 
it is not 
well .. if u feel it for a while .. not over days 
well .. no that much but to an extent can lead to sadness 
yes 
yes! bulls eye 
umm i would say yes 
yes i think so i think it depends on situation 
yes. very likely 
could be both yes and no 
umm not as much as happiness, sadness, etc. but you can still read it in context 
no it may be influenced by the results of others, so 
no. not this time, but yes for last time 
umm yes. it can be realted to both actually when result came out, mine is bad and yours is good. what emotion would I get? 
close but, no 
no u r going far 
no 
no u may feel embarrased because ur result is not good but target emotion may follow that you saw the other person's result is good 
no. but very close just different word with a bit less negative feeling 
no. jeolous is almost right but a bit less negative meaning in it or you can think as almost synonym 
yes! u r genius 
not necessarily You may feel like that or may not...it's not that related to frustration 
Not necessarily, again! But most of the time 
no 
generally yes, but not necessarily 
I think so, specially when compared to its opposite 
no 
no 
yes 
yes to some extent 
yes to some extent 
yes to some extent 
Not that much 
not exactly, but you are close to it 
not exactly, but it is related...focused was closer 
no, u got further 
yes 
no Do you want a hint? 
no 
yes, the name with "ness", but the state is the associated adjective definitely It is associated with using a chemical substance 
No, it is associated with alcohol 
NO! do you pay attention to my answers to questions you already asked? it's associated with NOT using a substance 
no 
possibly, yes 
in general, no 
no 
not necessarily but you could I suppose 
I think so... I don't normally steal stuff from friends though ;-)  
no 
no, it's not too typical of most enjoyable activities, though I can think of a few counter examples. 
no 
yes 
no 
no not necessarily 
in general, no.  But if the plate were very expensive and you were concerned about someone finding out (like the kid stealing), then maybe... 
yes, that's getting close 
no, but close 
yes 
I think that's number 16 no, that's a near synonym, but I think it's slightly different 
no, actually more the opposite... you don't want it to happen. 
yes, it's anxious... I think i'll count it, but that wasn't the exact word.  Do you know it? 
no 
Yes 
yes, but that was too easy hahah lets go again 
no 
no 
no it doesnt really relate to karma  
red yes 
no 
no 
yes 
yes (and yes... it's a yes/no question) 
yes 
yes, that too 
aha... yes, you got it! 
no 
yes 
yes, it can be (can I say more than "yes"?) 
yes 
no 
no but in regards to your earlier question "do you feel it when something goes wrong," the answer is yes, but it's not necessarily when something has gone wrong 
no 
it can, but not usually 
yes, but mostly kept to yourself 
no 
no 
yes 
no 
yes 
almost 
yea! 
no 
yes, it could 
yes, among other things... 
no, not necessarily 
no 
yes... good job! 
i think i get it, I would say neutral, but maybe a little red 
no 
no it' neutral *it's 
no 
yes 
no 
no 
no 
no, it's very breif *brief 
yup! 
no 
no, not usually super intense, but maybe in some cases 
yes 
no, not usually 
no 
no, it can be, but other things as well 
no 
yes 
yes, there's usually some happiness during and possibly after this emotion 
no 
no, but close.  It might come before relief. 
no, but close. 
no, but very close. 
no, but still pretty close 
no, I'd say it's less intense but maybe longer lasting 
yes!  Good job! 
no 
no 
no 
no, often after or during something negative 
yes 
no but it is in the neighborhood  
no 
yeah 
uhm no its more towards stressed out rather than scared but more intense than nervous 
almost it might be almost the same more negative 
almost its a bit more geared to when you are frustrated with another person I can tell u know because I think its almost the same as frustrated if u want 
no too far from frustrated 
no 
yes but that is the right track just more intense 
exaperated exasperated that is it!!!! 
yea 
it can be, but not only for people 
no, I meant you can feel it towards another person, but also for yourself and other things 
no 
it's clearly positive 
not when you're done, but maybe before it's done, while you're working on it 
yea 
yup! 
yes 
yes 
yes so not always intense* so it can be mild to but not so mild for it to be neutral 
No 
yes definitely 
You could but its not common 
no 
yes 
Uhm not necessarily it is felt in similar situations but its not the same. 
less intense 
no 
its different it is a reaction to something funny rather than something pleasing so no almost the same intensity 
no 
no 
yes 
no 
yes 
yes or smiling or at least smiling inside...if you know what I mena mean 
yes! 
nope 
no 
yes 
yes haha :-D 
no 
no 
you could but not always 
yes you can not always tho 
no 
yes 
could be stronger sorry I meant to say no, stronger 
yes 
yes 
no more negative  
no 
yes 
no 
could be yeah but not necesarilly necessarily 
no you can just feel it but it isnt necessarily vicious 
no a similar one 
I dont think so its very much like being furious 
no close tho you want to keep guessing you are so close I dont think you can ask anything that will get you closer cause they are almost synonyms 
angry 
no 
no 
yes it can be 
yes but less often than with sadness although in a similar way you get feel this emotion and then feel sad or angry about it 
yeah 
uhm it can but not necessarily  
it is embarrassment  
yea 
yea, but not limited to after having done something right but also before and during 
it can be, but id say usually, on a range from 1-10, 10 being the most intense, it'd be 6 or 7 actually maybe 5 
it's not calm at all 
yea 
no but it's associated with it 
yea 
yea 
not exactly 
mot really; satisfied is more of after an accomplishment has been made the emotion of thinking is mostly before and during 
kinda, more like being engaged in something 
you could, but it's not a very likely emotion you'd be feeling more like when you have a task to do 
on the right track 
no, you'd have to have a positive attitude 
definitely 
not exactly, it's more like determined than pride, because pride more like an emotion you'd feel afterwards and determined is what you feel while you're working on it 
yea! getting closer! 
it's similar, but more intense 
it's like a fusion of determined and delighted 
yea, but more energetic than optimistic 
it's cheerful and determined, but it's really similar to optimistic Not sure if there are more questions to ask that will give you the word; want me to tell you? 
it's enthusiastic :-P it's kinda difficult to guess 
no 
no 
n no you can feel angry with it but they are not associated  
same thing as with anger 
yeah you can 
no 
yeah its a possibility 
no it can go along with disappointment but its not the same 
yes 
yes 
yes! 
no 
it can be, but usually it's mild 
no, not at all 
no, it's not connected to anger or envy 
it can be, but it's not so much surprise but a sad realization 
more complex than dissapointment, specifically with people 
it's like a pain in your heart 
I've never heard it described that way, but you could say that 
yea 
no, not so much shock but more sadness 
It's lonely! 
no 
no but its mellow  
yes definitely 
similar but not the same content is a more constant emotion this is more common after you realize something 
yes 
relief! 
yes 
it can be but not necessarily 
it really ranges depending on the situation 
can be yeah it can be mixed with anger not the same tho 
yeah 
yeah I would say so 
no 
no 
no 
it can but a nasty surprise isnt necessary to feel this emotion 
probably not 
depends on the situation really 
it would be not a common emotion when a friend betrays you 
no 
no you would feel like this because an another person they might not cause this emotion intentionally  
can be but not necesarily 
Yeah it can be suffered from sorta like a pain 
can have yeah 
yeah 
no It happens when your neighbor gets something really nice 
yes envy 
no 
it can range, but a standard representation of it is relatively intense 
no, but associated with it oh ok it is sorry it can be linked with embarrassment, but i wouldn't use embarrassment as a bridge leading to the emotion i have in mind 
yes you can feel it when you perform 
yes it can 
yea 
yes 
more than that, worrying can be like a big test coming up, but the emotion i'm thinking of is more intense 
it's super close, but anxiety is like a cousin think more like instincts 
yea...i think that's a good synonym, it's fear! 
no 
no 
yeah 
this emotion will most likely lead to (be accompanied) by anger  
much more likely  actually sadness is not related to this emotion at all 
no 
you could but its not necessarily associated with being under high pressure 
yeah 
its not vengeful but yeah you might get vengeful 
not at all 
oh yeah plenty 
you can but it isnt the first emotion you would feel 
no 
yeah pain can be associated with this emotion? sorry no question mark 
yeah 
less likely 
yeah 
no 
no 
its annoyance  being annoyed 
no 
sort of, right direction but not so intense 
no think more social situation 
no 
no, it's more of a bad consequence 
yea,  you could 
not very closely but insecurity can be a result 
yea 
no, it's not that someone did something bad to you, but you did something bad to them 
so close actually that's it: guilt 
yes 
yeah it usually is 
yeah it can 
it can but is more common after 
its pride! 
no 
yea actually when you asked if it's intense it can have a huge effect on you, but you dont have an intense display of this emotion 
you can but not really 
no well it could, but i don't think anger will lead you in the right direction 
no 
not necessarily but maybe if you let them down after putting in a lot of effort. 
not really shame, it's more physical than psychological 
it's tired! 
yes 
not necessarily but you can yeah it varies a lot 
no laughing usually it is not very common 
you can but it isnt normally associated to this emotion 
it can vary from very mild to very intense\ 
no 
no 
no 
no it regards another person most of the time 
yes! very close  feeling affection 
yea 
not really, more on situations 
yea 
excitement is too energetic 
well the project would cause stress, so you wouldn't feel this emotion  
yea! well, more like content but basically the same, right? 
no 
yes 
no 
well its negative but it is also intense could be as intense as exhilaration just negative 
no different 
yeah def. 
yeah 
very similar 
yes stronger than despair tho 
different more towards being in despair 
you would give up beucase you feel like this kinda like feeling pain 
no 
yeah you could 
no if you were feeling this emotion you would be blaming yourself 
much stronger you feel this emotion and you probably feel stupid 
despair 
you would probably feel it simultaneously  
probably more 
soooo close you would ______ from hopelessness 
close too 
suffer 
nope 
not really 
yea but i wouldnt call it sad for real 
nope 
nope 
mayybe if theyyve caused you to be upset many times before 
no not usually. your scenario is an uncommon example 
no its more of an emotion that occurs after your own actions 
heh, no you wouldnt 
could be but wrong direction common emotion of college students 
nope 
no, more about work and stress 
thats it :-) 
yeah 
it can be but it can also be pretty mild 
you can but not because something is funny 
no 
No different  
yeah you could be plain happy and feel this emotion 
no 
yeah if you have been waiting for the concert for a while but its not that common 
noo you would look forward to feeling like this 
no more after rather than during 
yes!! 
yea 
on a scale of 1-5 id say 3.5 with 1 being least intense 
sorta, but its kinda like an energetic sadness, if that makrss sense 
well its not so much sad, more like bring uncomfortable *being 
thats the right direction 
not exactly

yep! 
no 
no 
It can vary but its not the most intense negative emotion  
no the other way more linked to sadness than anger 
no its close to sadness but not the same 
no its different because with this emotion you feel more than just sadness in regards to a situation 
yeah it could be 
similar too its when maybe you have disappointed somebody and you feel like you cant do anything to fix it 
yesss 
yes 
not really, but you can feel this emotion towards love 
more like if you think love's coming your way 
kinda 
kinda mux desire and excited 
but with excited 
yea! it was enthusiastic 
no 
much stronger and different* 
you would be desperate in a situation with this emotion but this emotion would prevail 
stronger but yes right path

yes close to both but its more something you would feel when you dont want to do something 
no closer to anguish think of the emotion you feel when there is a final and you dont want to do it 
close to doom  think of the emotion you get when you have to do something you really dont want to do 
hopeless close enough dread 
no 
not really 
no 
no, itd be more like sadness with stress 
no 
no, aggravation seems kinda dominant whereas the emotion is kinda submissive 
i would say so 
no more like in social situations 
thats it! 
yes 
as far as intensity its a medium  
yes definitely specially if were are worried about the test 
yes! 
yea

no 
yea! its conrenr (content 
no 
yes, in general 
no 
close, but no 
not usually good question! 
you could, but I think you'd have to have some kind of interaction/history with the stranger first 
yes! 
no but getting close 
yes, you could say that... someone might get smacked, and the experiencer might get high blood pressure 
no, it's stronger 
yep, you got it !  :-D  
yes 
yes, it can but not exclusively 
no 
yes, it can 
yes, I think so 
no 
no 
no 
no 
hmm, Yes, I think it relates a little bit 
not that strong, also it doesn't necessarily lead to sadness 
no, perhaps a little stronger 
no, but I think you're in the neighborhood 
yes yes, it has an origin, but it can pop up throughout the rest of your life 
yes ! 
no 
no 
yes 
no more like anger 
No it would happen more often after you have witnessed something 
yes 
it could be accompagnied by rage but it is not rage accompanied  
not every time but it is possible 
different 
closer yes 
no its different after you have seen something very distasteful for example 
yes possibly  
no 
Well it relates closely to the feeling that you got initially when watching the documentary about the meat you might have felt this emotion towards some of the scenes you saw 
disgust! thats it! 
no 
yea it usually is 
sorta, it's more sad than anger 
no 
do you mean it could progress into depression? it's not associated with depression depression seems not to be very energetic, but the emotion i'm thinking of kinda does 
if you're looking for him you would 
no 
definitely 
maybe a little less intense 
think more along the lines of the energy of being scared 
but less intense than being scared 
what would you feel when you have a scary test? 
yea! anxiety! 
no 
no 
yes 
no more a reaction to something you do 
yes guilt!!! 
it's kinda neutral 
yes 
yep 
yep 
yea you got it! 
yes 
yes it can be 
yes 
no but close you feel it when you are driving and think you are going to crash but you dont 
yes! 
no 
not really 
more like mad 
rage is super intense, the emotion i'm thinking of is pretty mild 
yea but more when you lose a regular sweater and it's cold out 
yea! it irritated/annoyed *it's 
no 
yes 
yeah similar 
not necessarily but it can 
yeah you would get this way after the match maybe not during it 
closer to bitter 
Yeah but its like when someone is just not in a good mood it can be combined with bitterness resentfulness 
grumpy! 
yes 
well, you can be really serious, but happy at the same time 
no 
no 
yea 
yea, but there's more of a focused energy 
umm, well , i think they're all synonyms, and its hard to differentiate; i was thinking determination 
No 
YES yes sorry no caps hahaha 
it can b e but not always 
yes \ when you feel this negative emotion you can also feel sadness 
yes 
yes very close 
yeah when someone does something you didnt expect 
close yeah  think about how you feel when your friend that was going to do a favor for you doesnt do it 
yes! disappointing  
no 
it can be, but it varies 
no, i'd say more it's more like anger than sadness, but it's not really anger 
haha no 
if you're scared of shots, yes 
yea, but think more like nervous 
well, they're all really similar, i was thinking something like  well, think more like paranoid mixed with anxious 
yea, but not so submissive as helplessness, more like you're stranded in a creepy forest and you're closely watching your surroundings 
haha, i was thinking wary 
yes 
yeah it can be 
yes 
close to relief think of a satisfaction? of a  synonym haha typo 
yeah you call that a word its when you are____ 
no you want to give up? its kinda hard  
yea 
yea 
not necessarily 
not always, think simple 
yea! oh, i mean, think more like plain happy, not happiness mixed in with something 
nope 
there you go! i was thinking exhilaration 
no 
sometimes 
there are many causes 
no 
no 
yes 
sorrow 
yes 
no 
maybe if it goes well rather when you get a good grade back 
it can be 
nope 
yea 
yep! 
no 
No 
yeah its closer 
yeah but it is not guilt 
no its more like after the fact you feel guilty and also something else 
no it is neither 
yes yes but what do you call when you are afraid you are going to get caught 
its kinda like scared, worried 
no 
i'd say more like sadness than anger, but it's like either *but it's not really like either 
not really, but you can be annoyed and this emotion at the same time or becuase you're annoyed, you can feel this emotion 
you could, but maybe more likely if they keep lying time after time 
maybe, but this emotion isn't really linked with social situaqtions 
yea, like a hard day's night :-D 
no 
maybe more like,you've had a long day, made many mistakes and you just wanna go home and rest 
no worries, exhausted is right! :-) 
no 
no 
uhm its really like neither it can happen when you are sad happy or angry but its bad 
no probably progressively  
yes 
yes 
no more like when you have a lot of homework 
its associated with overwhelmed 
closer to distress  think of hw 
yeesss!' 
no 
yes 
no well, it could be I guess, but not closely. 
hahaha... yes, quite possibly 
no 
no 
yes 
no 
yes, in some extreme cases. 
no, not so much (except as I said in extreme cases) 
yes, but the emphasis is on breaking your leg 
less about that, but it might be a factor 
yes it's often the beginning of suffering 
no, it's not really associated with sadness except in very extreme cases 
possibly, but I think the situation would have to be more extreme 
possibly... you might feel this emotion right before being extremely aggravated. 
yes 
no, it's similar to surprise but without the possibility of it being pleasant. 
yes 
no, more extreme and immediate... it's what you would feel before you realized you were dissapointed 
haha... pretty close.  it might be synonym, but this word is much more common 
yes, good job! 
yes 
no 
Not exactly bad, its unpleasant 
yes 
no 
it can be felt along with it but it isnt really associated with it 
no usually 
its jealousy! nice! 
no 
can be but there is a range. 
possibly... if it was your fault 
yes 
in certain cases, for example if she broke up with you because you cheated on her 
yes 
yep!  good job... 
no 
it can yeah 
uhmmm yeah possibly 
no but it is similar 
think fear but more specific 
closer very close but not exactly you can feel all of this due to this emotion 
no 
no 
yeah 
no think of the reason why someone wouldnt do something in front of people 
no it can go along but you feel this because you are afraid of feeling embarrassment 
close enough insecurity  insecure 
yes 
no 
somewhat... I would say they tend to coocur 
no not so much... 
yes and not just romantic love, ie, family too 
no actually you don't normally feel it towards anything 
somewhat... but like I said it's not about anything in particular. 
yes 
yes, in fact that might be a synonym, but I think you'll get it while I'm pondering... I think it's a little different, serene is usually a comfortable surrounding but you can be this emotion in any situation... 
no, not composed but it's also very close 
the same state of mind but it can be in any situation.... so not quite 
hahaha.... no its not that complicated... i think there is a cognate in spanish too 
yes, you definitely feel it in cases when you'd be tranquil/serene, but also say on a battle field if you are very well trained. 
ideally yes, but in general no 
yes, I think so but I think it's very close to tranquil/serene maybe I should count it... 
its kind of a prerequisite if you're agitated you can't focus, so you need to ____ down. 
aha!!! yeah, it's probably synonym, just that I think about it too much :-P 
yes 
yes 
no, not so much 
no 
it is a happy emotion, but happy isn't it.  For me at least, it's slightly different 
no, but good question though 
no, but it is kind of close.  this emotion is pleasurable and being satisfied is probably a prerequisite, but it's not any one particular aim/goal or cause. 
no, this emotion is a little more positive 
also pretty close, but no.  Less about any particular object of enjoyment.  you might enjoy being around a person feeling this emotion though. 
very close, but not so strong 
all your past couple of guesses are pretty close no 
yeah! 
no, it doesn't have to 
yes 
no 
yes 
it can be strong, but it doesn't have to be, so I would say no 
yes 
no 
yes 
very close, but not quite the same 
yep 
no i would say generally it's not considered positive 
no 
no 
you may but not necessarily 
not typically 
no definitely not when you're scared 
no 
no not while you are stressed but enough stress may lead you to feel this way 
no but being overwhelmed may cause you to feel this way 
it's not generally considered a good thing 
sort of 
no it's not intense 
no 
no i wouldn't really say that it is caused by external stimuli 
no 
hmmm it is internal and not cause by others 
but i wouldn't say it is very negative you couldn't feel this and be disappointed in yourself simultaneously  
no not at all it doesn't reflect how you feel about yourself 
sort of you're on the right track 
you would probably be in a calm state if you feel this 
no it's not really a positive feeling 
no but you are EXTREMELY close 
yes to the first not really to the second it is very similar to be uninterested that's a synonym so you got it :) it was apathy 
nope 
it can vary 
you could 
not at all 
nope, unless you were shocked at something your friend accomplished or received 
yea! i kinda gave too much info yeah you gave it away a little with that hint :) 
yes 
it can be but it can cover a pretty broad range of intensity 
no i wouldn't typically associate it with that situation 
no 
you may sort of 
ummm i wouldn't say it is more likely it depends who you are listening to the song with i guess 
yes 
very close 
that's it :) 
yes 
not really 
not necessarily after 
yea 
it's a little less goal-oriented than motivated 
yea, maybe something like playing poker 
yea, but keep the feeling of motivation in mind 
maybe, but it's more like motivation like positive energy 
yes well, maybe it's synonymous I was thinking hopeful
