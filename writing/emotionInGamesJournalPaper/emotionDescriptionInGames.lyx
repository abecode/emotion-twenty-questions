\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper we present a model of natural language description of emotion
 that is based on playing the emotion twenty questions game (EMO20Q).
 EMO20Q is a game of twenty questions limited to emotions.
 EMO20Q provides an experimental setting to observe natural language description
 of emotion in a game-based social scenario.
 First, we describe the collection of a corpus of people playing EMO20Q.
 In this stage we found that humans successfully guess the other player's
 emotion in 85% of the EMO20Q matches, even when the players were not restricted
 to a fixed list of emotion words.
 Then, we describe the construction of a question-asking dialog agent that
 can play the question-asking role of EMO20Q.
 Our results show that the agent is perceived as human-like and can identify
 a large set of non-prototypical emotions learned from observed human-human
 data.
 Even when the agent fails to correctly identify the subject's emotion,
 it is still perceived as human-like, despite performing worse than humans
 on the EMO20Q task.
 We also show how the agent's learned experience in playing EMO20Q can be
 used to generate declarative descriptions of emotions by creating a graph
 from the game data and calculating a shortest-path search through this
 graph.

\begin_layout Quote
In learning words, we have to learn to send and to receive.
 We have imagined a child learning to send 'Mama', and also to parrot the
 word on hearing it, but we have not considered intelligent hearing.
 What would count as intelligent response to the heard word 'Mama', and
 be observable enough for onlookers to appreciate and reinforce? Prompted
 assent is no game for such small children.
 Perhaps something rather like this: the child hears 'Mama' (say from the
 father) while sensing the mother in the periphery of his visual field,
 and then turns visibly on the mother.
 [...] It is the same old pattern of reinforcement, only this time the child's
 initial act is that of turning rather than babbling.
 Turning toward the mother while happening to hear 'Mama', the child is
 applauded and so is confirmed in the routine.
 But learning thus to face a named object does not have to await the whims
 of operant behavior; for the child can be directed.

This paper looks at how a computer can learn the meaning of emotion words
 by observing and playing a game.
 Rather than observing the emotion expressed by the players of the game,
 we look at how to characterize the semantic meaning of words that refer
 to emotions abstractly.
 In our research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Kazemzadeh2011a,Kazemzadeh2011b,Kazemzadeh2011c,Kazemzadeh2011d,Kazemzadeh2012"

we refer to this phenomenon as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The introductory quote provides a Skinnerian view for learning language,
 a behavioral view that focuses on stimulus response and reward-based learning.
 It also alludes to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

game of prompted assent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this paper, we consider how playing a game of prompted assent can provide
 an experimental paradigm for a computer to learn the language that humans
 use to talk about emotions.
 Being able to understand language 
\emph on
about 
\emph default
emotions, i.e.
 natural language description of emotion, as opposed to the general class
 of language that 
\emph on
expresses
\emph default
 emotions, is an important human ability to talk about emotions referentially.
 Thus we ask the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what words and phrases do people use to describe emotion in natural language?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than studying how they express emotions in language.
 To see the difference between expression and description, imagine an algorithm
 that looks at lexical choice in classifying a user's emotion.
 If the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

happy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is observed, it would most likely be correlated with the user expressing
 happiness, except when the user is applying the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

happy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to other people.
 In this case, we say that the usage of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

happy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is descriptive, rather than expressive.
 To be sure, there are cases where this distinction is blurred, especially
 when the emotion words are adjectives, but in the form of abstract nouns,
 such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

happiness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frustration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the descriptive usage is clearer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We take the position that the meaning of natural language descriptions of
 emotion must be defined in a way that can account for a system of heterogeneous
 agents that can communicate symbolically in a dialog setting similar to
 the the game of prompted assent mentioned in the quote.
 We call this game 
\emph on
Emotion Twenty Questions
\emph default
, or EMO20Q for short.
 In this game, one player picks an emotion word and the other player tries
 to guess by asking twenty or fewer questions.
 There is no preset list of emotion words because we aim for a descriptive,
 rather than prescriptive, model.
 In previous research we have formulated this game, experimented on humans
 playing this game via text chat, created software agents that can play
 this game, and observed basic performance characteristics of both humans
 and software agents.
 In this paper, describe this work and show how we can use the data that
 we have collected to generate natural language descriptions of emotions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is organized as follows.
 In the rest of this introduction, we discuss related work and the general
 topics that contextualize our work.
 The following two sections present the human-human and human-computer results
 of our experiments using EMO20Q.
 Finally we show how the data from these experiments can be used to generate
 descriptions of emotions.

\begin_layout Subsection
Emotion as Behavior Motivation and Its Role in Language Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main claims in this paper is that a game-based approach can help
 connect two different aspects of human emotions, (1) emotional motivation
 of behavior and (2) natural language description of emotion.
 The first has seen much focus in past research, from biological and neurologica
l models of emotion to computational models of intelligent agents.
 The second is an area of research that has been treated more indirectly
 in annotation studies and some ethnographic and theoretical research.
 We claim that looking at language from a behavioral learning point of view
 can bring these two aspects together using games as a game-based experimental
 methodology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first aspect, emotional behavior motivation, is derived from the observation
 that emotions play a large role in learned behavior, both consciously and
 unconsciously.
 At a very basic, biological level, positive and negative emotions can be
 seen as a feedback mechanism whereby certain behaviors are reinforced or
 punished 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rolls2005,Fellous2005"

\end_inset

.
 This view contrasts operant conditioning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Skinner1965"

\end_inset

, where behaviors are rewarded or punished after the behavior, from classical
 conditioning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pavlov2003"

\end_inset

, where behaviors are conditioned with antecedent or concurrent stimulus.
 In operant conditioning, condition responses tend to be more voluntary
 and can produce learned behaviors more robustly.
 It has been posited that emotional motivation of behavior causes learning
 not of specific behavior patterns but rather more abstract goals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rolls2005"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, whereas in lower animals feeding behavior might be specified directly
 in genes, in higher animals feeding behavior is rather an abstract goal
 which is genetically encoded and physiologically implemented through pleasure
 from feeding or pain from hunger, thus encoding a robust behavior patterns
 to achieve the goal of nourishment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a growing body of research from cognitive science and developmental
 psychology that shows that emotional behavior motivation plays a role in
 language learning behavior.
 One such area of research is in the question-asking period of child language
 acquisition.
 The two major hypotheses about this period of child development is that
 children ask questions for attention and that they are constructing explanation
s about the world.
 At first it would seem that the attention-seeking hypothesis would be a
 more emotional motivator of behavior and that the construction of explanations
 would be more cognitive.
 However, results show that it is not attention that satisfies children,
 in terms of number of questions asked, but rather receiving meaningful
 explanations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Frazier2009"

\end_inset

.
 The satisfaction of receiving an explanation can be seen in the same evolutiona
ry sense of emotion as behavior motivation.
 A succinct and provocative way of stating this hypothesis is the analogy
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explanation is to cognition as orgasm is to reproduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gopnik1998"

\end_inset

.
 However, both cases, attention-seeking and explanation seeking, can be
 seen as a positive reinforcement that can be modeled by question-asking
 games.
 The question of whether emotional behavior motivation can account for intellige
nt behavior more broadly, e.g.
 learning and problem solving, has been explored widely in intelligent agent
 architectures

 and in intelligent tutoring systems

 The idea is that games like EMO20Q can capture both the emotional utility

 natural language descriptions that explain emotions.

Natural Language Description of Emotion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focusing on natural language descriptions of emotion highlights the human
 ability to describe emotions as unique individual entities using language.
 It is useful to differentiate natural language description of emotion from
 other types of verbal expression of emotion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fussell2002"

\end_inset

 because doing so highlights the ability to externalize and communicate
 the idea of emotions as individual entities.
 It is a open question whether the emotions that we call

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 are unique, biologically speaking 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 For example, even a basic emotion like anger may not be reducible to a
 single, unique biological response 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

key "Skinner1965"

\end_inset

.
 However, when talking about emotions informally, or even when annotating
 emotional data in controlled settings, we talk about individual emotions
 as unique entities.
 The uniqueness of reference established by certain natural language expressions
 is known as definite description 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, but in the case of descriptions of emotions, the reference or denotation
 of these expressions is not clear.

\end_inset

Similarly, we assume that the meaning of emotion words used as labels of
 data mean more than the data they are applied to, and we use feature representa
tions and machine learning techniques to generalize from the observed training
 data to make predictions about unseen data.
 Hypothetically, at some point scientists may discover an underlying neurobiolog
ical basis for the emotions that we talk about informally, and in this case
 we may say that this neurobiological basis is what the natural language
 terms for emotions refer to.
 However, we claim that when people use emotion words informally, these
 words refer to 
\emph on

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or more colloquially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concepts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that are defined in relation to other words and expressions and that this
 meaning is arbitrated by conversational interaction that can be modeled
 as a game.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the EMO20Q game experiment to define this conceptual level of theoretical
 objects by making reference to observed behavior.
 This framework for meaning is implicit in the distributional hypothesis
 which forms the basic assumptions in statistical natural language processing,
 but the game metaphor focuses on the interactive use of language, rather
 than a document-based approach.
 Though the game-theoretic formulation of the statistical usage patterns
 of language goes back to Shannon's language game, more recently the ability
 to gather interactive usage data on the World Wide Web has made statistical
 learning from from games a possibility.
 Such games 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ahn2004,Ahn2006"

\end_inset

, called games with a purpose, try to harness the interactive patterns of
 human behavior in order to do tasks that are difficult for computers.
 At a basic level, these games-with-a-purpose can be seen as simply a way
 to collect training data for machine learning.
 However, at a deeper level, one can surmise that making a computer more
 intelligent should also include making the computer a skilled, interactive
 game player, rather than simply a way to collect data.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In an earlier paper, we distinguished 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scientific
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meaning of emotion words from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

folk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meaning of emotion words.
 However, research into different aspects of emotion research shows that
 even there is actually much variation in the meaning scientific terminology.
 For example, scientists in different areas of emotion research make the
 distinction between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emotions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feelings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Though the conceptual distinction is the same, namely to distinguish conscious,
 reflective affect from unconscious, biological affect, the mapping of these
 two concepts to the two terms is completely switched depending on which
 scientists work is being read.
 In the work of Rolls and Damasio, for example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feelings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refer to conscious, reflective affect and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emotions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refer to unconscious, biological affect.
 However, in Ortony et al.
 and Scherer these symbols are reversed with respect to their underlying
 meanings and hence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emotions are interpeted feelings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In retrospect, it may not make sense to distinguish scientific and folk
 theories of emotion, since scientific theories are not a single voice any
 more than folk theories are.

Russell (1991) suggests the other possibility that different languages recognize
 different emotions because emotion words in other languages do not exist
 in the English language.
 For example, the word "ijirashi" in Japanese refers to a feeling associated
 with seeing someone praiseworthy overcoming an obstacle.
 There is no English equivalent for this emotion word.
 There are also English emotion words that are missing altogether in other
 languages.
 The emotion word "anxiety" does not exist among the Eskimos and Yorubas.
 In addition, there is no translation equivalent for the word "anxiety"
 in Chinese.
 There is also the claim that there is no word for "depression" among many
 non-Western cultural groups.
 However, the study conducted by Brandt and Boucher (1986) suggests otherwise.
 Depression-type words were a part of each culture studied, in both Western
 and non-Western cultures.
 It is also important to note that much of the research concerned with cross-cul
tural similarities and differences in emotion lexicons focuses on single
 words, such as "love" and "sadness".
 Although there may not be a one word equivalent across cultures it is possible
 that languages can express emotions and ideas other than those that are
 coded in single words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Russell (1983) compared the circular ordering for English emotion words
 to that of four other languages--Croatian, Gujarati, Chinese (Cantonese),
 and Japanese.
 Each participant was given a deck of 28 cards, with one emotion term on
 each card.
 Each participant was asked to sort the cards into 4, 7, 10, and 13 groups
 on successive trials, with more similar emotional states grouped together.
 Results revealed that a similar structure emerged for each language.
 The emotion terms fell into a circular order among the two dimensions of
 pleasure-displeasure and arousal-sleep.
 Although individual words varied somewhat in their circular ordering and
 position space, they never varied enough to obscure the overall configuration.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We collected a total of 110 matches from 25 players in the human-human EMO20Q
 experiments.
 On average this is about 8 matches per player.
 However, we had two main types of subject: volunteers and paid participants.
 Most volunteers played two matches per player, one match per role, so two
 matches per subject was the median.
 The paid participants were part of a longitudinal experiment that aimed
 to see the effect of playing the game with each other over a longer period
 of time, which resulted in a maximum of 57 matches for the two longitudinal
 experiments.
 The EMO20Q experiment was is implemented as an online chat application
 using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) so that the
 games can be easily recorded and studied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early in our pilot studies, we realized that it was difficult to successfully
 terminate the game when the questioner guessed words that were synonyms
 of the word the answerer picked.
 This led us to treat the phenomenon of synonyms with an additional rule
 that allowed the game to terminate if the answerer could not verbally explain
 any difference between the two words.
 In this case, we considered the game to terminate successfully, but we
 flagged these matches and kept track of both words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the surface forms of the questions vary widely, we used manual preprocessi
ng to standardize the questions to a logical form that is invariant to wording.
 This logical form converted the surface forms to a pseudo-code language
 with a controlled vocabulary by converting the emotion names to nouns if
 possible, standardizing attributes of emotions and the relations of emotions
 to situations and events.
 Examples of the standardized questions are shown in Tab.

 After this semantic standardization, there were a total of 727 question
 types.

After the manual normalization we found that there were 37 questions types
 that had been asked at least twice, eight questions types that were asked
 three times, four that were asked at least four times (a total of 90 question
 tokens were repeated at least twice).
 Examining the normalized questions revealed interesting patterns of question
 reuse through the social interactions of the players, though more longitudinal
 data will be needed to rigorously characterize these interactions.
 Approximately half of the questions were emotion identity questions.

\begin_layout Standard
To get a better idea of the relative frequencies of general types of questions,
 we made the following high level characterization of the questions using
 the following broad categories: 
\emph on
identity questions 
\emph default
(guessing an emotion), 
\emph on
attribute questions
\emph default
 (asking about dimensional attribute like valence or activation), 
\emph on
similarity/subsethood questions 
\emph default
(asking if the emotion in question is similar to or a type of another emotion),
 
\emph on
situational questions
\emph default
 (questions that ask about specific situations associated with the emotion
 in question), 
\emph on
behavior questions 
\emph default
(questions that are asked about the behavior associated with the emotion
 in question), 
\emph on
causal questions
\emph default
 (questions about the cause, effect, or dependency of the emotion in question),
 
\emph on
social questions
\emph default
 (questions asking about other parties involved in the emotion--this overlaps
 somewhat with causal questions and situational questions), 
\emph on
miscellaneous questions 
\emph default
(questions that defied classification or had categories with too few examples).
 Some examples of these categories are given in Tab.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Converting the theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 to the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, as described above, allows us to use methods from collaborative filtering,
 social network analysis, and spectral graph theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kunegis2009,Hou2005"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, we use the number of zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of
 the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to determine the number of connected components of the graph.
 This can be seen as a measure of the sparsity of our data and can be used
 to identify the questions that must be asked of certain emotions in order
 to connect the graph components.
 The Laplacian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 of a signed graph is calculated by subtracting the absolute adjacency matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

 from the diagonal absolute degree matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}_{ii}=\sum_{j}|A_{ij}|$
\end_inset

 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=\bar{D}-|A|
\]

\end_inset

From the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 we can tell the number of connected components of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by counting the number of zero eigenvalues.
 Thus, if there are three eigenvalues that equal zero, the graph is composed
 of three separate connected components.
 A graph Laplacian with one zero eigenvalue is a single connected graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If an agent has identified that it has unconnected knowledge, how can it
 then plan questions to address the knowledge goal of connecting the components
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

? To answer this, we must define the notion of a 
\emph on
walk
\emph default
 on a graph.
 A walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 on graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that joins vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a sequence of vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}\ldots u_{l}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}=u_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=u_{l}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 are adjacent for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le t\le l$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "Lemma 2.5"
key "Biggs1974"

\end_inset

, the number of walks of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that join 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the entry in cell 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, by taking repeated powers of the absolute adjacency matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

, we can determine if nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by walks of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 Since the graph is bipartite, the walks from question nodes to other question
 nodes or from object nodes to other object nodes will always be even length,
 and conversely, walks between question and object nodes will be odd length.
 This behavior is undesirable because we wish to preserve connectedness
 properties across repeated powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{l}.$
\end_inset

 To remedy this undesirable behavior we can augment the adjacency matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

 by adding the identity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 to it.
 At this point, we can say that vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by a walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
or less
\emph default
 if the entry 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A+I)^{l}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero.
 The proof of this, by contradiction, is that that if we imagine that vertices
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by some walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k<l$
\end_inset

, but not of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

, then there must not be self-loop from 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 to itself after the walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 However, since we added the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 matrix to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 we know that there are in fact self-loops on all of the vertices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The preceding fact allows us to state an alternative test for connectedness
 and also allows us to identify the question-object pairs that need to be
 asked to complete the agent's knowledge.
 This test can be stated as follows: the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is connected if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(|A|+I)^{M+N-1}
\]

\end_inset

 has no zero entries.
 This is because the length of a walk with distinct steps, a 
\emph on
path
\emph default
, is at most one less than the number of vertices in the graph, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $M+N-1$
\end_inset

, which would be the case if the graph were a linked list.
 The question-object pairs that correspond to zero entries in this matrix
 are precisely the set of candidate questions that need to be asked to connect
 the agent's knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The reader may wonder what is the purpose of using the graph Laplacian method
 to determine whether the graph is connected when this can be accomplished
 using the method of taking powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A+I)$
\end_inset

.
 While it is true that the latter method can accomplish the same objective
 of determining whether the graph is complete, the Laplacian eigenvalue
 method tell 
\emph on
how many
\emph default
 connected components there are.
 This information is useful because it can tell us how many questions need
 to be asked.
 For example, if zero is an eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, as described
 in Section , and this eigenvalue has multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 (i.e., there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 eigenvalues equal to zero), the minimum number of questions that need to
 be asked is the number of edges to create a spanning tree on 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 nodes.
 In this paper, we do not consider any type of weighting on the added edges,
 so any minimal set of questions that connect the disconnected components
 of the graph are satisfactory for the purposes of this paper.
 This minimal set of edges is simply any tree that connects the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 disconnected components.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 questions must be asked since there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 edges in a tree of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 nodes.
 One could imagine additional constraints that further identify a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 set of question-object pairs, for example, the set of questions whose added
 edges minimizes the diameter of the resulting graph.

Successful Game Outcome Rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 110 matches played between the 25 human players, 94 -- approximately
 85% -- terminated successfully with the questioner correctly identifying
 the emotion that the answerer picked or a word that the answerer felt was
 a synonym.
 The mean and median number of questions asked per game was 12.0 and 10,
 respectively, when failures to correctly guess the emotion were averaged
 in as 20 questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 94 successfully terminated matches, 22 terminated with synonyms.
 The 16 unsuccessfully terminated matches that were considered failures
 consisted of several distinct cases.
 The questioner player could give up early if they had no clue (5/16), they
 could give up at twenty questions (1/16), or they could pass twenty questions
 due to losing count or as a matter of pride (6/16).
 The four remaining cases were considered failures because the answerer
 inadvertently gave away the answer due to a typing error or giving an unnecessa
rily generous hint.
 These four cases were all in the longitudinal experiment.

The spectral analysis of the question-emotion graph showed us that there
 were four separate subgraphs, meaning that we have not collected enough
 data to produce a single connected theory that will allow us to compare
 individual differences and commonalities.
 This result is useful in that it provided a criteria for determining how
 much data is needed to produce a connected graph.
 Indeed, we will need to collect more data and perhaps ask targeted questions
 to connect the graph off-line.

The model we used for the agent is a sequential Bayesian belief update algorithm
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 that starts with a conditional probability distribution estimated from
 a corpus of human-human and human-computer EMO20Q.
 The human-human data was described in the previous section and the human-comput
er data was derived from earlier versions of the agent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In this data, there was a set of 105 emotion words that were observed.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 be this set of emotion words derived from the human-human and human computer
 data and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\in E$
\end_inset

 be a categorical, Bayesian (i.e., unobserved) random variable distributed
 over this set.
 Also, let each question-answer pair from the match of EMO20Q be considered
 as an observed feature of the emotion being predicted.
 Thus if 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the set of questions and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the set of answers, then question 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in Q$
\end_inset

 and answer 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in A$
\end_inset

 together compose the feature 
\begin_inset Formula $f=(q,a)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in Q\times A$
\end_inset

.
 The conditional probability distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(f|\varepsilon)$
\end_inset

, is estimated from the training data using an additive smoothing factor
 of 0.5 to deal with sparsity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our model we stipulate that the set of answers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are four discrete cases: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

none
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When the answer either contains forms of either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is labeled accordingly.
 The forms of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that recognized in the answer string are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

Aye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were both examples of when users playfully tested the system by using non-stand
ard forms of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the answer string did not contain either of these forms, it is labeled
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is other category includes the case where forms of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were both found in the answer string (e.g.
 if the user answered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it could be both yes and no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feature value 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

none
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is assigned to all the questions that were not asked in a given dialog.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

None
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be seen as a missing feature when the absence of a feature may be important.
 For example, the fact that a certain question was not asked about a particular
 emotion may be due to the fact that that question was not relevant at a
 given point in a dialog.
 It is also used for bookkeeping so that probabilities of observations add
 to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, we stipulate that the questions can be classified into some discrete
 class that is specified through a semantic expression as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kazemzadeh2011a"

\end_inset

.
 For example, the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is it a positive emotion?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is represented as the semantic expression 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

e.valence==positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the answer to this question was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maybe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the resulting feature would be represented as

\begin_layout Standard
Using Bayes rule and the independence assumption of the na
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
"{i}
\end_layout

\end_inset

ve Bayes model, we can formulate the agent's belief about the emotion vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 after observing features 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}...f_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t})= & \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{t}\left[P(f_{i}|\varepsilon)\right]P(\varepsilon)}{\prod_{i=1}^{t}P(f_{i})}\end{split}
.\label{eq:naivebayes}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 When the game begins the agent starts with a uniform prior as its belief
 over emotion words: 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\varepsilon=e_{k})=1/|E|,\thickspace\forall k=1...|E|$
\end_inset

.
 We chose to use the uniform prior to start with because our training data
 contains many single count training instances and because we want to examine
 how the system performs with less constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:naivebayes"

\end_inset

, the posterior belief of the agent of emotion 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\varepsilon=e_{k}|f_{1},...,f_{t})$
\end_inset

 is computed only after the agent has asked the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 questions and the classification decision would be made at this time.
 In contrast the formulation we use is dynamic in that the agent updates
 its belief at each time point based on the posterior probability of the
 previous step, i.e., at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t}) & = & \frac{P(f_{t}|\varepsilon)P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t-1})}{P(f_{t})}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

This formulation allows the belief to be updated gradually as each question
 is asked.
 Also, the classification decision can be broken up into several guesses.
 We introducing a new variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t,k}=P(\varepsilon=e_{k}|f_{1},...,f_{t})$
\end_inset

 for the agent's belief about emotion 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and postulate that the agent's current prior belief is the posterior belief
 of the previous step.
 Then, the agent's belief unfolds according to the formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta_{0,k} & = & P(\varepsilon=e_{k})=1/|E|\nonumber \\
\beta_{1,k} & = & \frac{P(f_{1}|\varepsilon=e_{k})}{P(f_{1})}\beta_{0,k}\nonumber \\
\beta_{t,k} & = & \frac{P(f_{t}|\varepsilon=e_{k})}{P(f_{t})}\beta_{t-1,k}\label{eq:adaptive}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Decomposing the computation of the posterior belief also allows the agent
 to choose the best question to ask the user at each turn, rather than having
 a fixed battery of questions.
 In this case, we define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the question that is most likely to have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answer given 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 This criterion indicates how often the question was observed in the training
 data in the context of emotions as they are weighted by the agent's current
 belief
\begin_inset Formula $P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t-1})$
\end_inset

.
 The agent asks the best question and takes the user's response as input.
 It then parses the input to classify it into one of {
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

}.
 This information is then used to update the agent's belief as to which
 emotion in 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 in most likely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identity questions are a special type of question where the agent makes
 a guess about the emotion.
 An affirmative answer to an identity question (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is it happy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) means that the agent successfully identified the user's chosen emotion.
 Any other answer to an identity question will set the posterior probability
 of that emotion to zero because the agent can be sure it is not the emotion
 of interest.
 Also, because it is playing a twenty questions game 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is set to 20, but this could be changed for the agent to generalize to
 different question-asking tasks.
 The pseudo-code for the main loop of the adaptive Bayesian agent is shown
 in Algorithm .

key "Kazemzadeh2012"

\end_inset

.
 We collected experimental data of fifteen subjects each playing three EMO20Q
 matches.
 The subjects were asked to pick 3 emotion words, one easy word, one medium
 word, and one difficult one, based on how difficult they thought it would
 be to guess.
 They were also asked to rate the naturalness of the agent on a 0-10 scale,
 and were given an opportunity for open-ended comments.

The results of our usability experiments on fifteen subjects are summarized
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:experimental-results}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 To compare the agent's performance with human performance, we used two
 objective measures and one subjective measure.
 The success rate, shown in column two Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:experimental-results}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, is an objective measure of how often the EMO20Q matches ended with the
 agent successfully guessing the user's emotion.
 The number of turns it took for the agent to guess the emotion is the other
 objective measure.
 The last column, naturalness, is a subjective measure where users rated
 how human-like the agent was, on a 0-10 scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emotion words chosen by the subjects as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were recognized by the agent with similar success rate and number of required
 turns as human-human matches.
 Some examples of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 emotions are anger, happiness, and sadness.
 However, successful outcomes were fewer in emotions chosen as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

medium
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

difficult
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Some examples of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

medium
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 emotions are contentment, curiosity, love, and tiredness.
 Pride, frustration, vindication, and zealousness are examples of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

difficult
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 emotions.
 The different classes of words were not disjoint: some words like anger,
 disgust, and confusion spanned several categories.
 Though the difficulty of an emotion word may be subjective, using difficulty
 as a prompt helped to elicit a wide variety of emotion words, including
 words that were out of the agent's vocabulary.
 A complete listing of the words chosen by the subjects of the experiment
 is given in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:words}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results in terms of successful outcomes and number of turns required
 to guess the emotion word are roughly reflected in the percent of words
 that are in vocabulary.
 Despite the low performance on emotion words deemed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

medium
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

difficult
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there was not a corresponding decrease in the perceived naturalness of
 the questioner agent.
 This, together with the corresponding out of vocabulary statistics, indicates
 that the lower performance is due more to data sparsity than to the model
 and algorithm.

\begin_layout Section
Generation of Natural Language Descriptions of Emotion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reward-based Shortest Path Description Generation Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model how natural language description of emotion can be learned from
 previously played games, we use a reward-based learning paradigm.
 An agent with reward-based learning attempts to maximize some reward function
 by interacting with an uncertain environment.
 In the reinforcement learning literature, actions are typically referred
 to by the letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in mathematical formulae.
 However, in our case our actions are the questions, so to preclude any
 confusion between actions and answers, we will use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

q
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to refer to the actions.
 We will assume that answers are a form of reward, and that certain answers,
 such as affirmative answers, will receive more reward than others.
 This reward is the sum of the individual rewards at each time step, or
 turn in the twenty questions game:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R=\sum_{t=1}^{T}r_{t}
\]

\end_inset

Where the individual rewards at each time step is defined as a function
 of the current state, the action, and the resulting state.
 In this case, the state is the observed sequence of question-answer pairs
 at a certain point in a dialog.
 For the dialog state, we use a feature-based representation using discretized
 versions of the questions and answers, as described in 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
mbox{
\end_layout

\end_inset

Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Human-Computer-EMO20Q"

\end_inset


\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 be the set of questions and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 the set of answers.
 Then a question 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in Q$
\end_inset

 and an answer 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in A$
\end_inset

 together compose the feature 
\begin_inset Formula $f=(q,a)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in Q\times A$
\end_inset

.
 The dialog game state is represented as a sequence of features 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0},...,f_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Because we assume that the agent's state can be uniquely determined by
 the sequence of questions and answers in it's episodic buffer and its current
 belief state, we will assume that the reward at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is specified as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{t}=r(\{f_{0},...,f_{t}\},q,a)
\]

\end_inset

Under the assumption that questions that the reward amount is parametrized
 by the answers to the questions, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 can vary depending on the answer type: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{t}=\begin{cases}
r_{y} & if\, a="yes"\\
r_{n} & if\, a="no"\\
r_{o} & \mbox{else}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

, we used 1, 0, and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, respectively, to capture the intuition that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answers give the greatest reward, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answers do not receive a reward but also do not incur a cost, and unsure
 answers incur a cost without any reward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model the generation of emotion descriptions, we consider a good description
 to be a series of declarative sentences that would result from a high reward
 strategy of playing EMO20Q.
 To do this, we construct a game graph of transitions from one question
 to another with probabilities derived from the observed data and rewards
 as established by 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and find the shortest path by Dijkstra's algorithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conversion of questions to declarative sentences was done using manual
 conversion of questions from the EMO20Q data into answer templates, and
 then substitution of strings for the templates using a mixture of automatic
 and manually created regular expression substitution rules.
 For example, the frequently used question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is the emotion you picked a positive emotion?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was represented in as an answer template as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{e:the emotion you picked} is a positive emotion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Another example of a question/answer template pair is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you feel the emotion about yourself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{experiencer:you} can feel {e:the emotion} about {experiencer-reflexive:yourself
}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The regular expression substitution rules interpolate the strings delimited
 by the curly brackets (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) with a random value from the values indexed by the string preceding the
 colon in the curly bracket-delimited strings.
 For example, the bracketed strings indexed by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

e
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could be replaced by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the emotion you picked
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the emotion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or simply 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 More complex substitutions, like the reflexive pronoun in the example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you feel the emotion about yourself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, were realized as manually created substitution rules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conversion of an affirmative declarative sentence into a negative or
 uncertain one was implemented as manually created regular expression substituti
on rules.
 The simplest rule involved substituting the copula 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is not
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Slightly more complicated, sentences with the modal helping verbs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

could
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

would
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 involved negating these verbs as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can't
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

couldn't
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wouldn't
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If these rules did not match, there were three main exceptions.
 One case involved an arbitrary verb predicated of the emotion, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the emotion makes you smile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this the verb was stripped of its inflection and preceded by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doesn't
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the emotion doesn't make you smile.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Another case involved predicating a person or group of people experiencing
 the emotion, e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

people feel it at Disneyland.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In this case, the verb was preceded by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

people don't feel it at Disneyland.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The third case of exceptions to the general rule was when there was a quantifie
r like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

only
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expressed in the sentence, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you only feel this emotion when you are betrayed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In this case, the sentences negation would be generated by preceding the
 quantifier with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you not only feel this emotion when you are betrayed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This third exception was applied before all the other rules and the two
 others were applied after.
 Also, the application of the rules was exclusive, that is only one rule,
 the first rule that matches, would be applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For questions that were answered in a way other than affirmative, we simply
 preceded the whole sentence with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maybe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This design choice reflected the fact that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 category is a catch-all that could not be generated any more precisely.
 A finer scale categorization of answers that were not answered with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a current area of our research.

, one can see the generated description for a word that was used frequently
 in the EMO20Q data.
 In general this emotion word was also guessed in a small number of questions,
 so the path lengths in the graph tend to be short.
 However, the bias towards affirmative answers can cause frequently chosen
 emotion words to have longer descriptions.

\begin_layout Standard
In general, these results on emotion description generation show the possibiliti
es of representing natural language descriptions of emotions using game-like
 models with reward functions for various actions.
 Currently, the semantics used are fairly shallow, so generated descriptions
 have redundancy that could be made more concise using a deeper semantic
 model.
 Also, the generation of a single path is only one possible application.
 For other applications, such as recognizing descriptions of emotion in
 text, it may be better to keep the information in a lattice data structure
 that would maintain the representation of multiple paths.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper we presented the EMO20Q game and discussed the experimental
 data from both human-human and human-computer games.
 We also showed how the data from the game can be used to generate declarative
 descriptions of emotion by decoding through the game graph with transitions
 that were weighted with rewards based on whether the question was answered
 affirmatively, negatively, or otherwise.
 We found that when the game is played among humans, the successful outcome
 of EMO20Q, i.e.
 when the emotion was guessed correctly, occurred in 85% of the matches.
 This successful outcome rate shows that there is a high degree of agreement
 between the way different people describe and understand emotions.
 In fact, this agreement, when compared to annotation tasks, is quite high,
 especially considering that there was no a priori list of emotion words
 used.
 When we created a computer agent to play the questioner role of EMO20Q,
 the successful outcome rate was lower: 44% over words of varying difficulty
 and performance sharply degraded with the self-reported emotion word difficulty.
 Though this is much lower than the human-human upper bound, it represents
 the state-of-the-art in this new research area.
 Also, despite the low successful outcome rate in human-computer games,
 the subjective naturalness rating assigned by the users stayed stable across
 the difficulty levels while the success rate was more correlated with the
 out-of-vocabulary rate.
 This indicates that the model and algorithm presented are performing well
 but that we need to collect more data.
 Finally, the data collected from the EMO20Q game can be used to generate
 declarative descriptions of emotion.
 We consider the language-based question-asking game paradigm to be a useful
 way to model the way that an agent can learn subjective language behavior
 that could be applied to other domains besides natural language description
 of emotion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In future work, we plan to develop this research in several ways.
 First, the results indicate that the most critical short-coming is the
 lack of data, as seen in the out-of-vocabulary rates in our human-computer
 data.
 Collecting more data is thus the most promising direction to improve our
 results.
 From the description generation point of view, the questions that were
 answered with a reply other than affirmative or negative are the least
 informative descriptions.
 However, this is a by-product of our coarse partitioning of answers into
 yes/no/other categories.
 We think that a finer partition of the answers in this category could make
 these turns more informative, which would perhaps require different associated
 reward weights.
 Finally, from a longer term research perspective, we plan to study different
 languages using EMO20Q.
 Though emotion from a biological perspective is presumably similar across
 different cultures, when we consider linguistic description of emotion
 it is not clear how much diversity there will be across languages and cultures.
