A Socratic Epistemology for Verbal Emotional Intelligence

\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper we claim that question asking provides a natural framework
 for acquiring representing knowledge about emotions.
 Question asking has a well-founded theoretical basis that goes back to
 ancient times.
 We develop a framework for empirically observing human question-asking
 behavior as a means for dealing with subjective information about emotions.
 Dealing with linguistic knowledge in this way gives insight about how to
 represent emotions for use in natural language technology.
 First, we build a corpus of people playing emotion twenty questions (EMO20Q),
 a game of twenty questions limited to words denoting emotion.
 Then, we create a question-asking dialog agent that can deal with this
 subjective information about emotions and test it experimentally with over
 100 players.
 Our results show that the agent is perceived as human-like and can identify
 a large set of non-prototypical emotions learned from observed human-human
 data.
 Even when the agent fails to correctly identify the subject's emotion,
 it is still perceived as human-like, despite performing worse than humans
 on the EMO20Q task.
 We believe that the agent's behavior of searching for knowledge, and not
 the agent's knowledge itself, is responsible for this subjective performance
 rating.

 Natural language descriptions of emotion are utterances that refer to emotions
 directly.
 They can be seen as a subset of the larger phenomenon of emotional language,
 which also includes emotion or sentiment expressed towards some object,
 vocal modulation due to emotion, and persuasion and pragmatics.

In this sense, it is a change of focus from some of the prevalent trends
 in researching natural language expressions of emotion and has more in
 common with theoretical and representational issues in affective computing.
 However, this approach differs from theoretical works in that we eschew
 the notion of a fixed emotional vocabulary and in our approach, the theory
 is generated by ordinary language users rather than scientists.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We maintain that studying question-asking dialogs about emotion shows the
 capability of humans to use a large, rich, subjective vocabulary of emotion
 words and provides a theory of emotion description that captures the shared
 meaning of natural language.
 The framework we present differs from other theories of emotion in that
 it aims to study how people describe emotions, rather than how emotions
 
\emph on
should be
\emph default
 described.
 As such, it can be seen as a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, theory,
 and hence has commonalities with sociological studies of emotions

.
 Although there is a biological basis for emotions, the way that people
 describe emotions in natural language varies over time from culture to
 culture and person to person.
 A descriptive theory of verbal description of emotion should reflect this
 variation.
 Thus, a particular instantiation of an emotional theory that is based on
 natural language should be relative to a particular agent or set of agents
 at a given time who hold similar beliefs and communicate using the same
 language.
 Rather than trying to establish a particular definition for emotion words,
 we study how shared meaning can be established through verbal behavior
 even when people may have different ways of describing emotions.

The key goals of this paper are to use question-asking to observe natural
 language descriptions of emotion in a natural context and to computationally
 model the social processes that support the referential link between language
 and emotions.
 In the next section, we will discuss the motivations and theory behind
 our work.
 Next, we discuss the data we collected of people playing emotion twenty
 questions (EMO20Q).
 The following section describes the computational model and algorithm we
 used to create an EMO20Q questioner agent.
 Finally we examine a computational model for curiosity for the agent.

The precise point that humans began to use language to name and describe
 emotions most likely predates writing.
 However the early writings quoted below show that description of emotions
 using language goes back to antiquity.

 In the first quote above, Gorgias, a Sophist rhetorician, describes the
 effects of words on a person's emotions.
 Gorgias describes emotions both by using his rhetorical skills and by making
 reference to the theory of physiological humors.
 The conception of emotions has changed since the time of the ancients,
 who believed that emotions were generated from bodily 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

humors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which in turn were derived from alchemical elements.
 In the second quote, Socrates (as quoted by Plato) cross-examines Gorgias
 to determine Gorgias' beliefs.
 Socrates applied his method of inquiry to examine concepts that seem to
 lack any concrete definition, in particular some of the moral concepts
 of his time like

In

 we described the construction of a person-specific theories of emotions
 based on data from EMO20Q, inspired by the definition of a theory from
 mathematical logic, where a theory is defined as the set of propositions
 in some language that is true of a model.
 In the view proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kazemzadeh2011a"

\end_inset

, a person's verbal intelligence was the model that determined whether natural
 language statements about emotions as were true or false with respect to
 a given emotion and particular person.
 This view was inspired by the notion of a theory in mathematical logic,
 which defines a theory as a set of statements that are true of a particular
 model.
 This person-specific theory can be thought of a representation of a person's
 knowledge or beliefs.
 Viewed in this way, a person specific theory of emotions is more appropriately
 an issue of epistemology, rather than formal logic, because deals with
 a theory of knowledge, belief, and justification.
 Epistemology traditionally sees knowledge as true, justified belief.
 As an example, one can belief in God, and God can actually exist, but without
 justification, one cannot call this true belief 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

knowledge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 unless it is justified in some way.
 In this paper we shift our focus from truth of statements in a model to
 the process of justification of beliefs.
 The particular way in which we try to observe the knowlege that people
 have about emotions is inspired by the Socratic method of asking questions,
 which is why we call it a

Natural Language Descriptions of Emotions

Just as memory addresses, variables, and URLs refer to electronic resources
 for computers, so to do words and descriptions identify objects, both physical
 and conceptual, for humans.
 When processing natural language by computer, it can help to draw upon
 these similarities.
 This is especially the case in the case of affective computing, when the
 objects we wish to reference are abstract and subjective.

In this paper we make a distinction between the emotion

 Currently there has been a great degree of interest in automatically analyzing
 the emotional content of language.
 The language used as input to this kind of analysis can be a speech recording
 or textual representation of language.
 The goal of such analysis is to determine emotions 
\emph on

 the speaker or writer, i.e., the emotions that the speaker currently feels.
 However, analyzing an utterance or document at a gross level, automatic
 analysis can be confused when a speaker

\emph default
 emotions that are not his or her own current emotions.
 Examples of this are quotations, storytelling/gossip, counterfactual reasoning,

 In the natural language processing (NLP) domain we present in this paper,
 there is a need for analysis that is sensitive to such a distinction.
 This game of EMO20Q is primarily about 
\emph on
referring to
\emph default
 emotions: the players pick hypothetical emotions--not necessarily the emotions
 they feel--to use in a twenty questions-type game.
 In the game, players also 
\emph on
express
\emph default
 emotions: they are happy or relieved when they correctly guess the emotion
 and feel mild anguish if they cannot.
 However, in this paper we focus on they behavior of the players when they
 
\emph on
refer to 
\emph default
emotions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The game of EMO20Q was primarily designed as a way to elicit natural language
 descriptions of emotion: how people refer to emotions abstractly using
 language.
 While it is possible to communicate one's emotions to a first-hand observer
 by facial expressions, vocal modulation, or lexical choice, in order to
 communicate emotional information to others who are not first-hand observers
 it is necessary to describe emotions abstractly rather than to simply express
 or display the emotions.
 At the most basic level, natural language descriptions of emotions include
 words that name emotions, e.g.
 
\emph on
angry
\emph default
, 
\emph on
happiness
\emph default
, etc.
 However, due to the productive, generative nature of natural language,
 it is possible to refine and generalize emotion descriptions with longer
 natural language phrases.
 Furthermore, natural language descriptions of emotions can be related to
 each other in a similar way that words are related to other words through
 their dictionary definitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to communicate using natural language descriptions of emotions,
 people must be able to come to a shared understanding about the meaning
 of these descriptions.

 Considering natural language descriptions of emotions in this way begs
 the question of whether natural language descriptions of emotions are definite
 descriptions or not.
 By considering terms that refer to emotions as definite descriptions, we
 are trying to capture the intuition that people mean the same things when
 they use the same emotion terms.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the question is posed of whether emotions are natural kind terms, to which
 the paper answered no, i.e., that different emotion terms represent non-unique
 classes of human behavior rather than fundamentally distinct natural classes.
 The question of whether emotion terms are definite descriptions can be
 seen as a less stringent criterion than that of a natural kind.

In this paper we formulate natural language descriptions of emotions in
 terms of definite descriptions and we show how such references to emotions
 are grounded in natural language dialogs using an adaptation of the mathematica
l notion of convergence empirically grounded in observed natural language
 dialogs.

 In this paper, we apply the notion of definite descriptions to capture
 the experimental data which indicates that there is a high degree of concensus
 about how emotions are described when measured by EMO20Q.

By relying on the wisdom of the masses, we can venture a simple answer to
 the difficult question, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is emotion?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The answer, according to crowd-sourcing, is that emotion is what most people
 say it is.
 Although this answer side-steps many important issues, such as physiological
 and psychological descriptions of emotions, it does bring other issues
 into sharper focus.
 Currently, there is a movement toward studying non-prototypical emotional
 data.
 Non-prototypical emotional data is exemplified by disagreement among annotators
 when assigning emotional labels to data.
 We argue that a crowd-sourced description of emotions can effectively deal
 with non-prototypical emotions.
 To avoid falling into the 
\emph on
ad populem
\emph default
 logical fallacy, we formulate the answer to the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is emotion?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 not as a question of truth, but a question of knowledge and belief, i.e.,
 an issue of epistemology, in effect skirting the question of ground truth,
 but asking another interesting question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what do people believe about emotions and how do they express these beliefs
 in language?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering people's beliefs about emotions from the point of view
 of an annotation task, some of the disagreement between annotators with
 respect to non-prototypical emotion data can actually be seen as an artifact
 of being forced to choose from a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 emotions.
 Moreover, annotation tasks typically ask annotators to assign natural language
 descriptors to data without the context of natural language interaction,
 i.e.
 without the implied communicative goals that are shared with another interlocut
or.
 When the annotation task is set up as a forced choice between one of several
 labels, it is obvious that any emotional data that does not fit into the
 preassigned labels will be seen as non-prototypical.
 However, more fundamentally, even when there is an open choice of emotion
 labels, the task of annotation is divorced from the full context of natural
 language interaction, so agreement is defined as a hit-or-miss event.
 For this reason, many annotation methodologies use a manual or training
 (e.g.
 ADOS for autism diagnosis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lord2000"

\end_inset

) to establish the context for the shared meaning of the annotation vocabulary.
 However, in the case of annotating emotions, the technical vocabulary overlaps
 with the natural language terms, so there is the potential for ambiguity
 between the meaning established by the annotation standards and the meaning
 of everyday language

The game of EMO20Q addresses the issue of agreement about emotion descriptions
 when the descriptive process is contextualized in natural language interaction.
 EMO20Q is played like the traditional game of twenty questions, except
 that one player, the 
\emph on
answerer
\emph default
, must choose an emotion term.
 The other player, the 
\emph on
questioner
\emph default
, must try to guess the emotion that the answerer picked by posing a series
 of twenty or fewer questions.
 Importantly, we do not restrict the set of emotion terms that the players
 can choose nor the questions they can ask: the set of emotion terms and
 questions is not limited except by the players' judgment and cooperation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EMO20Q game is an effective way to elicit language that people use to
 state their beliefs about emotions.
 In terms of the utility of EMO20Q as an experimental design, we distinguish
 the human-human version of the game, which is played by two human players,
 and the human-computer version of the game, in which one player is a computer.
 In this paper we consider the case where the question-asker, or 
\emph on
questioner
\emph default
, is a computer.

 has focused on controlled experiments for studying emotional language,
 usually eliciting responses from subjects who are presented with words
 as stimuli.
 However, the stimuli are predetermined and the responses are constrained,
 often as a Likert scale or prescribed set of emotion categories.
 In EMO20Q, potentially any word can be chosen as an emotion word and any
 question can be asked of it; it is only limited by the game's rules, the
 subjects' good-faith sportsmanship and the extent to which that one player's
 model of emotions overlaps with the other player's model.
 Thus, in contrast with purely elicited experiments, EMO20Q can be presumed
 to have higher experimental validity and less experimental bias.
 The player/subjects of EMO20Q are less constrained by the elicitation methodolo
gy and, all other factors being equal, we can assume that their honesty
 and cooperation is comparable to elicitation experiments, or perhaps improved
 due to the presence of the other player and the players' shared communicative
 goals.
 Thus we can assume EMO20Q to have less experimental effects than in experiments
 with guided/elicited responses.
 There is the possibility of experimental effects due to interactions between
 players, which we consider in the analysis of our results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One drawback of this approach is that it is hard to quantify reliability
 in the unconstrained interactions of EMO20Q.
 Reliability can be measured in the amount of agreement between subjects,
 but this can be difficult because we do not force subjects to pick any
 particular words, so the words that are in common between users are determined
 by chance and hence sparse.
 Determining an appropriate sample size as well as methods to deal with
 sparsity are important characteristics of this methodology which we discuss
 later.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because of this, an alternative way to measure reliability could be done
 in offline question-answering of specific question-emotion pairs, which
 could be repeated across subjects
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage of the EMO20Q methodology is the potential to provide
 more experimental sensitivity.
 Receiving stimuli and giving responses using the same modality, natural
 language, has the potential to be much more sensitive than Likert scales
 or restricting user input to fixed choices.
 This is because we can assume that natural language has the capabilities
 of expressing most, if not all, of the nuanced distinctions between emotions.
 Even in cases where one is literally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at a loss for words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there are natural language descriptions, like the quoted phrase, that
 people use to approximate such an emotion.
 One exception where the natural language modality could be less sensitive
 is in the case of children and non-native speakers.
 In this case, we can imagine less fluent subjects who have conceptual distincti
ons in their beliefs about emotions that they are not able to verbally express
 without the aid of elicitation.
 Detangling the variability in cognitive and verbal capabilities is a challenge
 for the EMO20Q methodology though we could hypothesize that a verbal limitation
 would be observable in subjects requiring more questions, while cognitive
 limitations would be observable in subjects failing to guess correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methodological utility of the natural language modality in EMO20Q can
 be seen in the productivity, ubiquity, and social aspects of language,
 as well as the relation to engineering solutions, such as natural language
 processing.

 can be seen as a

Data and Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We collected a total of 110 matches from 25 players in the human-human EMO20Q
 experiments.
 On average this is about 8 matches per player.
 However, we had two main types of subject: volunteers and paid participants.
 Most volunteers played two matches per player, one match per role, so two
 matches per subject was the median.
 The paid participants were part of a longitudinal experiment that aimed
 to see the effect of playing the game with each other over a longer period
 of time, which resulted in a maximum of 57 matches for the two longitudinal
 experiments.
 The EMO20Q experiment was is implemented as an online chat application
 using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) so that the
 games can be easily recorded and studied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early in our pilot studies, we realized that it was difficult to successfully
 terminate the game when the questioner guessed words that were synonyms
 of the word the answerer picked.
 This led us to treat the phenomenon of synonyms with an additional rule
 that allowed the game to terminate if the answerer could not verbally explain
 any difference between the two words.
 In this case, we considered the game to terminate successfully, but we
 flagged these matches and kept track of both words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the surface forms of the questions vary widely, we used manual preprocessi
ng to standardize the questions to a logical form that is invariant to wording.
 This logical form converted the surface forms to a pseudo-code language
 with a controlled vocabulary by converting the emotion names to nouns if
 possible, standardizing attributes of emotions and the relations of emotions
 to situations and events.
 Examples of the standardized questions are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Question-Standardization"

.
 After this semantic standardization, there were a total of 727 question
 types.

After the manual normalization we found that there were 37 questions types
 that had been asked at least twice, eight questions types that were asked
 three times, four that were asked at least four times (a total of 90 question
 tokens were repeated at least twice).
 Examining the normalized questions revealed interesting patterns of question

 data will be needed to rigorously characterize these interactions.
 Approximately half of the questions were emotion identity questions.

, the number of walks of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that join 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the entry in cell 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, by taking repeated powers of the absolute adjacency matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

, we can determine if nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by walks of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 Since the graph is bipartite, the walks from question nodes to other question
 nodes or from object nodes to other object nodes will always be even length,
 and conversely, walks between question and object nodes will be odd length.
 This behavior is undesirable because we wish to preserve connectedness
 properties across repeated powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{l}.$
\end_inset

 To remedy this undesirable behavior we can augment the adjacency matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

 by adding the identity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 to it.
 At this point, we can say that vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by a walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
or less
\emph default
 if the entry 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A+I)^{l}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero.
 The proof of this, by contradiction, is that that if we imagine that vertices
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by some walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k<l$
\end_inset

, but not of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

, then there must not be self-loop from 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 to itself after the walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 However, since we added the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 matrix to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 we know that there are in fact self-loops on all of the vertices.

The preceding fact allows us to state an alternative test for connectedness
 and also allows us to identify the question-object pairs that need to be
 asked to complete the agent's knowledge.
 This test can be stated as follows: the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is connected if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(|A|+I)^{M+N-1}
\]

\end_inset

 has no zero entries.
 This is because the length of a walk with distinct steps, a 
\emph on
path
\emph default
, is at most one less than the number of vertices in the graph, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $M+N-1$
\end_inset

, which would be the case if the graph were a linked list.
 The question-object pairs that correspond to zero entries in this matrix
 are precisely the set of candidate questions that need to be asked to connect
 the agent's knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The reader may wonder what is the purpose of using the graph Laplacian method
 to determine whether the graph is connected when this can be accomplished
 using the method of taking powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A+I)$
\end_inset

.
 While it is true that the latter method can accomplish the same objective
 of determining whether the graph is complete, the Laplacian eigenvalue
 method tell 
\emph on
how many
\emph default
 connected components there are.
 This information is useful because it can tell us how many questions need
 to be asked.
 For example, if zero is an eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, as described
 in Section , and this eigenvalue has multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 (i.e., there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 eigenvalues equal to zero), the minimum number of questions that need to
 be asked is the number of edges to create a spanning tree on 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 nodes.
 In this paper, we do not consider any type of weighting on the added edges,
 so any minimal set of questions that connect the disconnected components
 of the graph are satisfactory for the purposes of this paper.
 This minimal set of edges is simply any tree that connects the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 disconnected components.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 questions must be asked since there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 edges in a tree of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 nodes.
 One could imagine additional constraints that further identify a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 set of question-object pairs, for example, the set of questions whose added
 edges minimizes the diameter of the resulting graph.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Successful Game Outcome Rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 110 matches played between the 25 human players, 94 -- approximately
 85% -- terminated successfully with the questioner correctly identifying
 the emotion that the answerer picked or a word that the answerer felt was
 a synonym.
 The mean and median number of questions asked per game was 12.0 and 10,
 respectively, when failures to correctly guess the emotion were averaged
 in as 20 questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 94 successfully terminated matches, 22 terminated with synonyms.
 The 16 unsuccessfully terminated matches that were considered failures
 consisted of several distinct cases.
 The questioner player could give up early if they had no clue (5/16), they
 could give up at twenty questions (1/16), or they could pass twenty questions
 due to losing count or as a matter of pride (6/16).
 The four remaining cases were considered failures because the answerer
 inadvertently gave away the answer due to a typing error or giving an unnecessa
rily generous hint.
 These four cases were all in the longitudinal experiment.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The spectral analysis of the question-emotion graph showed us that there
 were four separate subgraphs, meaning that we have not collected enough
 data to produce a single connected theory that will allow us to compare
 individual differences and commonalities.
 This result is useful in that it provided a criteria for determining how
 much data is needed to produce a connected graph.
 Indeed, we will need to collect more data and perhaps ask targeted questions
 to connect the graph off-line.

The model we use for the agent is a sequential Bayesian belief update algorithm
 that starts with a conditional probability distribution estimated from
 a corpus of human-human and human-computer EMO20Q.
 The human-human data was described in the previous section and the human-comput
er data was derived from earlier versions of the agent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kazemzadeh2011d"

\end_inset

.
 In this data, there was a set of 105 emotion words that were observed.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 be this set of 105 emotion words and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\in E$
\end_inset

 be a categorical, Bayesian (i.e., unobserved) random variable distributed
 over this set.
 Each question-answer pair from the match of EMO20Q is considered as an
 observed feature of the emotion being predicted.
 Thus if 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the set of questions and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the set of answers, then a question 
\begin_inset Formula $q\in Q$
\end_inset

 and an answer 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in A$
\end_inset

 together compose the feature 
\begin_inset Formula $f=(q,a)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in Q\times A$
\end_inset

.
 The conditional probability distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(f|\varepsilon)$
\end_inset

, is estimated from the training data using a smoothing factor of 0.5 to
 deal with sparsity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our model we stipulate that the set of answers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

None
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be seen as a missing feature when the absence of a feature may be important.
 For example, the fact that a certain question was not asked about a particular
 emotion may be due to the fact that that question was not relevant at a
 given point in a dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, we stipulate that the questions can be classified into some discrete
 class that is specified through a semantic expression as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kazemzadeh2011a"

\end_inset

.
 For example, the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is it a positive emotion?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is represented as the semantic expression 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

e.valence==positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the answer to this question was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maybe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the resulting feature would be represented as 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard
Using Bayes rule and the independence assumption of the na
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
"{i}
\end_layout

\end_inset

ve Bayes model, we can formulate the agent's belief about the emotion vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 after observing features 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}...f_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t})= & \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{t}\left[P(f_{i}|\varepsilon)\right]P(\varepsilon)}{\prod_{i=1}^{t}P(f_{i})}\end{split}
.\label{eq:naivebayes}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 When the game begins the agent can start with a uniform prior on its belief
 of which emotion is likely or it can use information obtained in previously
 played games.
 In the experiment of this paper, we use a uniform prior, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\varepsilon=e_{k})=1/|E|,\thickspace\forall k=1...|E|$
\end_inset

.
 We chose to use the uniform prior to start with because our training data
 contains many single count training instances and because we want to examine
 how the system performs with less constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:naivebayes"

\end_inset

, the posterior belief of the agent of emotion 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\varepsilon=e_{k}|f_{1},...,f_{t})$
\end_inset

 is computed only after the agent has asked the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 questions.
 In contrast the formulation we use is dynamic in that the agent updates
 its belief at each time point based on the posterior probability of the
 previous step, i.e., at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t}) & = & \frac{P(f_{t}|\varepsilon)P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t-1})}{P(f_{t})}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We introduce a new variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t,k}=P(\varepsilon=e_{k}|f_{1},...,f_{t})$
\end_inset

 for the agent's belief about emotion 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and postulate that the agent's current prior belief is the posterior belief
 of the previous step.
 Then, the agent's belief unfolds according to the formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta_{0,k} & = & P(\varepsilon=e_{k})=1/|E|\nonumber \\
\beta_{1,k} & = & \frac{P(f_{1}|\varepsilon=e_{k})}{P(f_{1})}\beta_{0,k}\nonumber \\
\beta_{t,k} & = & \frac{P(f_{t}|\varepsilon=e_{k})}{P(f_{t})}\beta_{t-1,k}\label{eq:adaptive}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Decomposing the computation of the posterior belief allows the agent to
 choose the best question to ask the user at each turn, rather than having
 a fixed battery of questions.
 In this case, we define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the question that is most likely to have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answer given 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 This criterion indicates how often the question was observed in the training
 data in the context of emotions as they are currently weighted by 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\varepsilon|f_{1},...,f_{t-1})$
\end_inset

.
 The agent asks the best question and takes the user's response as input.
 It then parses the input to classify it into one of {
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

}.
 This information is then used to update the agent's belief as to which
 emotion in 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 in most likely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identity questions are a special type of question where the agent makes
 a guess about the emotion.
 An affirmative answer to an identity question (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is it happy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) means that the agent successfully identified the user's chosen emotion.
 Any other answer to an identity question will set the posterior probability
 of that emotion to zero because the agent can be sure it is not the emotion
 of interest.
 Also, because it is playing a twenty questions game, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is set to 20, but this could be changed for the agent to generalize to
 different question-asking tasks.

\end_inset

.
 We collected experimental data of fifteen subjects each playing three EMO20Q
 matches.
 The subjects were asked to pick 3 emotion words, one easy word, one medium
 word, and one difficult one, based on how difficult they thought it would
 be to guess.
 They were also asked to rate the naturalness of the agent on a 0-10 scale,
 and were given an opportunity for open-ended comments.

 agent successfully guessing the user's emotion.
 The number of turns it took for the agent to guess the emotion is the other
 objective measure.
 The last column, naturalness, is a subjective measure where users rated

A Computational Model of Curiosity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous result, in which the subjects rated the agent as being relatively
 human-like even in cases when the EMO20Q task performance was low, seems
 to indicate that there is something human-like in the search for knowledge,
 rather than having a complete representation of emotions that would allow
 it to guess correctly and win at EMO20Q more often.
 In an earlier paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kazemzadeh2011b"

\end_inset

, we proposed a model for verbally exploring a sparse graphical representation
 of an agent's knowledge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Representing the agent's knowledge as an adjacency graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, allows us to use methods from collaborative filtering, social network
 analysis, and spectral graph theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kunegis2009,Hou2005"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, we use the number of zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of
 the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to determine the number of connected components of the graph.
 This can be seen as a measure of the sparsity of our data and can be used
 to identify the questions that must be asked of certain emotions in order
 to connect the graph components.
 In this way, we can have a rudimentary representation of curiosity in terms
 of the agent's exploration of this graph.
 To construct this graph we built a graph in the following way: questions
 and answers are nodes in the graph which are linked by edges labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 if the question is answered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of that emotion and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 if the question is answered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the emotion.
 Thus the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is bipartite in that emotion nodes are connected to question nodes, but
 there are no edges between any two emotion nodes or between any two question
 nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used the Laplacian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 of this graph to calculate the connectivity and to identify which nodes
 were unconnected.
 The Laplacian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 of a signed graph is calculated by subtracting the absolute adjacency matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

 from the diagonal absolute degree matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}_{ii}=\sum_{j}|A_{ij}|$
\end_inset

 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=\bar{D}-|A|
\]

\end_inset

From the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 we can tell the number of connected components of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by counting the number of zero eigenvalues.
 Thus, if there are three eigenvalues that equal zero, the graph is composed
 of three separate connected components.
 A graph Laplacian with one zero eigenvalue is a single connected graph.
 Moreover, the lowest 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 non-zero eigenvalues can be used to project nodes in the graph into an
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional space (this is similar to principal components analysis (PCA)
 except that in PCA instances are projected to be farther apart, whereas
 in the graph projection, connected nodes ought to be projected close by).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an agent has identified that it has unconnected knowledge, how can it
 then plan questions to address the knowledge goal of connecting the components
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

? To answer this, we must define the notion of a 
\emph on
walk
\emph default
 on a graph.
 A walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 on graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that joins vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a sequence of vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}\ldots u_{l}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}=u_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=u_{l}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 are adjacent for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le t\le l$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "Lemma 2.5"
key "Biggs1974"

\end_inset

, the number of walks of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that join 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the entry in cell 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, by taking repeated powers of the absolute adjacency matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

, we can determine if nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by walks of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 Since the graph is bipartite, the walks from question nodes to other question
 nodes or from object nodes to other object nodes will always be even length,
 and conversely, walks between question and object nodes will be odd length.
 This behavior is undesirable because we wish to preserve connectedness
 properties across repeated powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{l}.$
\end_inset

 To remedy this undesirable behavior we can augment the adjacency matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|$
\end_inset

 by adding the identity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 to it.
 At this point, we can say that vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by a walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
or less
\emph default
 if the entry 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A+I)^{l}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero.
 The proof of this, by contradiction, is that if we imagine that vertices
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 are connected by some walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k<l$
\end_inset

, but not of length 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

, then there must not be self-loop from 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 to itself after the walk of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 However, since we added the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 matrix to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 we know that there are in fact self-loops on all of the vertices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preceding fact allows us to state an alternative test for connectedness
 and also allows us to identify the question-object pairs that need to be
 asked to complete the agent's knowledge.
 This test can be stated as follows: the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is connected if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(|A|+I)^{M+N-1}
\]

\end_inset

 has no zero entries, where 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the number of emotions and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of questions.
 This is because the length of a walk with distinct steps, a 
\emph on
path
\emph default
, is at most one less than the number of vertices in the graph, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $M+N-1$
\end_inset

, which would be the case if the graph were a linked list.
 The question-object pairs that correspond to zero entries in this matrix
 are precisely the set of candidate questions that need to be asked to connect
 the agent's knowledge and choosing which one to ask can be determined by
 using 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 to project the current state of the dialog into the graph's space.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reader may ask what use is it to study the variety of ways that emotion
 can be described in natural language.
 For example, what use is it to know that for some people, the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pride
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proud
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may have different connotations?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[regarding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proud
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pride
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] because my intuition was that they're different...
 you know pride sometimes has a negative connotation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anger
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is might not always described as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[questioner:] so is it a negative emotion? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[answerer:] sort of, but it can be righteous
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some purposes it might be sufficient to consider 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anger
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be simply a negative emotion, or that the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pride
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proud
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to refer to the same emotion.
 However, from nearly every line of EMO20Q data we can see that the ways
 that humans describe emotions are much more nuanced.
 One of the main results of this study is that when asking questions about
 emotions at this level of detail, we can, in Socrates' words, reach mutual
 edification.
 Precisely, among humans playing EMO20Q mutual edification happens about
 85% of the time after about 12 dialog turns.
 This represents a high amount of agreement for an emotional classification
 task, especially considering that the set of emotional classes was unbounded.
 Although analyzing this level of detail is beyond the scope of many current
 systems, we have shown that it is a task that humans can do with success
 rates that beat agreement rates on emotional annotations at a much coarser
 level, such as labeling data with nine basic emotion labels

\begin_layout Standard
Natural language presents many difficulties for describing emotions: synonymy,
 ambiguity, subjectivity, and data sparsity, among others.
 We feel that the additional complexity of using natural language as a way
 of describing emotions in computational frameworks will be challenging,
 but will offer insight into problems that continue to vex the field of
 affective computing as well as other tasks where descriptions are subjective
 and established through language, such as deriving behavioral analytics
 for clinical assessment.

The ground truth issue involved in annotating recorded data with descriptive
 labels is a challenge that the Socratic epistemology can shed light on.
 The traditional annotation task seeks to have human annotators assign one
 of a number of labels to data.
 In the case of emotion research, usually the labels are a controlled vocabulary
 of several emotion descriptors, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

angry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

happy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disgusted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fearful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surprised
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The problem with this approach is that these labels have a linguistic meaning
 in addition to their meaning in a controlled vocabulary.
 The linguistic meaning is not part of a closed set of alternatives, but
 rather an iterative process of communication.
 In affective computing the issue of non-prototypical emotions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mower2009"

\end_inset

, observed data that does not fit into the controlled vocabulary of emotional
 descriptors, is due to the artificial nature of annotation tasks that only
 have a fixed set of options.
 By allowing an open set of natural language descriptions, the problem of
 non-prototypical emotions is traded for more complexity in analyzing natural
 language descriptions.
 We have proposed the Socratic epistemology as a way of dealing with this
 new challenge.

In our data, automatic analysis of emotion content must distinguish emotion
 expression and reference to emotion.
 However, in the data there is usually a clear distinction between gameplay
 turns and other chatting, which effectively isolates the two types of emotional
 language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Conversational entrainment, a long term (dialog-level) phenomena, shows
 that (hopefully) this type of emotional expression is correlated with the
 efficacy of emotion description, i.e.

Emotional lexicon/vocabulary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even though the EMO20Q experiment was designed to focus on when people refer
 to emotions, this is not to say that EMO20Q does not elicit emotional responses
: in fact, it does cause players to feel and express emotions.
 One of the emotions it elicits is frustration and mild anguish when a player
 cannot guess a word, similar to the feeling when a word is on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tip of one's tongue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Also, guessing in EMO20Q often elicits joy or relief.
 Similarly, other affective behaviors can be seen in EMO20Q, for example
 rapport and entrainment between players is reflected in the game outcome.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goals of this paper were to use question-asking to observe natural
 language descriptions of emotion in a natural context and to computationally
 model the social processes that support the referential link between language
 and emotions.
 We presented the emotion twenty questions (EMO20Q) game and showed that
 the level of human performance was high despite not limiting the players
 to any specific emotion vocabulary.
 We also presented two computational models for automated players of EMO20Q.
 First, we showed that a sequential Bayesian belief update algorithm could
 model the question asking player's belief state over time.
 Second, we showed a graphical model can represent the connectivity of an
 agent's knowledge which can be used to choose questions that represent
 unknown states as a way to model curiosity.
 This framework was inspired by a method of question-asking that was proposed
 by the ancient philosopher Socrates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We deem that future advances in affective computing can come from studying
 emotions at a finer grain, as they are described in natural language.
 We plan to continue studying this phenomena in several ways.
 First, we hope to see the effect of modality on how people describe emotions
 in natural language.
 The current work was limited to text-based chat, so paralinguistic information
 that may help to convey emotional data was minimized.
 Including audio and video data may allow greater convergence of the players
 to agree upon the unknown emotion.
 Another area of future research will be to examine the answerer role.
 The current research focused on the questioner role, but the answerer role
 will offer additional challenges and insights.
 In particular, automating the answerer role will require more robust natural
 language understanding and it will allow a closed loop simulation where
 both roles of EMO20Q are played by computer.
