# Introduction #

Emotion Twenty Questions (emo20q) can be played face-to-face, by phone, or any number of different media. However, to isolate the human behavior that we want to study, the first emo20q experiments were played over the XMPP chat software, ejabberd.

To get ejabberd configured, you basically do a vanilla installation with 2 modifications: message logging and a global user roster.  These topics are described on other webpages.  Simply googling for these topics should be enough to figure it out, but for convenience, I will put the instructions here in one place:


# Details #

  * instructions for setting up the [shared roster](http://www.ejabberd.im/shared-roster-all) (i.e., everyone has everyone as a contact)

  * instructions for setting up [message logging](http://www.ejabberd.im/mod_log_chat), which enables the chats to be saved so that we can study them.
